The penalties applicable to offences involving the different drugs are graded broadly according to the <em>harmfulness attributable to a drug when it is misused</em> and for this purpose the drugs are defined in the following three classes:</p><ul class="cW"><li><p><strong>Class A</strong> includes: alfentanil, cocaine, diamorphine (heroin), dipipanone, lysergide (LSD), methadone, methylenedioxymethamfetamine (MDMA, ‘ecstasy’), morphine, opium, pethidine, phencyclidine, remifentanil, and class B substances when prepared for injection</p> </li><li><p><strong>Class B</strong> includes: oral ampfetamines, barbiturates, cannabis, cannabis resin, codeine, ethylmorphine, glutethimide, nabilone, pentazocine, phenmetrazine, and pholcodine</p> </li><li><p><strong>Class C</strong> includes: certain drugs related to the amfetamines such as benzfetamine and chlorphentermine, buprenorphine, diethylpropion, mazindol, meprobamate, pemoline, pipradrol, most benzodiazepines, zolpidem, androgenic and anabolic steroids, clenbuterol, chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), non-human chorionic gonadotrophin, somatotropin, somatrem, and somatropin</p> </li></ul><p>The Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (and subsequent amendments) define the classes of person who are authorised to supply and possess controlled drugs while acting in their professional capacities and lay down the conditions under which these activities may be carried out. In the regulations drugs are divided into five schedules each specifying the requirements governing such activities as import, export, production, supply, possession, prescribing, and record keeping which apply to them.</p><ul class="cW"><li><p><strong>Schedule 1</strong> includes drugs such as lysergide which is not used medicinally. Possession and supply are prohibited except in accordance with Home Office authority.</p> </li><li><p><strong>Schedule 2</strong> includes drugs such as diamorphine (heroin), morphine, nabilone, remifentanil, pethidine, secobarbital, glutethimide, amfetamine, and cocaine and are subject to the full controlled drug requirements relating to prescriptions, safe custody (except for secobarbital), the need to keep registers, etc. (unless exempted in Schedule 5).</p> </li><li><p><strong>Schedule 3</strong> includes the barbiturates (except secobarbital, now Schedule 2), buprenorphine, diethylpropion, mazindol, meprobamate, midazolam, pentazocine, phentermine, and temazepam. They are subject to the special prescription requirements (except for temazepam) and to the safe custody requirements (except for any 5,5 disubstituted barbituric acid (e.g. phenobarbital), mazindol, meprobamate, midazolam, pentazocine, phentermine, or any stereoisomeric form or salts of the above). Records in registers do not need to be kept (although there are requirements for the retention of invoices for 2 years).</p> </li><li><p><strong>Schedule 4</strong> includes in Part I benzodiazepines (except temazepam and midazolam, which are in Schedule 3) and zolpidem, which are subject to minimal control. Part II includes androgenic and anabolic steroids, clenbuterol, chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), non-human chorionic gonadotrophin, somatotropin, somatrem, and somatropin. Controlled drug prescription requirements do not apply and Schedule 4 Controlled Drugs are not subject to safe custody requirements.</p> </li><li><p><strong>Schedule 5</strong> includes those preparations which, because of their strength, are exempt from virtually all Controlled Drug requirements other than retention of invoices for two years.</p> </li></ul><div id="PHP80"><h2>Prescriptions</h2><p>Preparations in Schedules 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (and subsequent amendments) are identified throughout the BNF using the following symbols: </p><ul><li><p><img src="images/cd1_s.png" alt="Schedule 1 Controlled Drug" /> for preparations in Schedule 1; </p> </li><li><p><img src="images/cd2_s.png" alt="Schedule 2 Controlled Drug" /> for preparations in Schedule 2; </p> </li><li><p><img src="images/cd3_s.png" alt="Schedule 3 Controlled Drug" /> for preparations in Schedule 3; </p> </li><li><p><img src="images/cd4-1_s.png" alt="Schedule 4 (Part I) Controlled Drug" /> for preparations in Schedule 4 (Part I); </p> </li><li><p><img src="images/cd4-2_s.png" alt="Schedule 4 (Part II) Controlled Drug" /> for preparations in Schedule 4 (Part II).</p> </li></ul><p> The principal legal requirements relating to medical prescriptions are listed below (see also <a title="target-block: RPSGB guidance" href="PHP79-controlled-drugs-and-drug-dependence.htm#PHP82">Department of Health Guidance</a>).</p> <div class="cI" id="PHP81"><h3 class="cT">Prescription requirements</h3><p>Prescriptions for Controlled Drugs that are subject to prescription requirements<cite><a href="PHP79-controlled-drugs-and-drug-dependence.htm#ID0EJBCJAA" class="tooltip ID0EJBCJAA">(1)</a></cite> must be indelible,<cite><a href="PHP79-controlled-drugs-and-drug-dependence.htm#ID0EHBCJAA" class="tooltip ID0EHBCJAA">(2)</a></cite> and must be <em>signed</em> by the prescriber, <em>be dated,</em> and specify the prescriber's <em>address</em>.

For arrangements for prescribing of diamorphine, dipipanone, or cocaine for addicts, see <a title="topic: Prescribing of diamorphine (heroin), dipipanone, and cocaine for addicts" href="PHP87-prescribing-of-diamorphine-heroin-dipipanone-and-cocaine-for-addicts.htm">Prescribing of Diamorphine (heroin) Dipipanone, and Cocaine for Addicts</a>.</p><p>Despite marked reduction in the prescribing of <strong>amfetamines</strong>, there is concern that abuse of illicit amfetamine and related compounds is widespread.</p><p><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> are commonly misused. However, the misuse of <strong>barbiturates</strong> is now uncommon, in line with declining medicinal use and consequent availability.</p>  <p><strong>Cannabis</strong> (Indian hemp) has no approved medicinal use and cannot be prescribed by doctors. Its use is illegal but widespread. Cannabis is a mild hallucinogen seldom accompanied by a desire to increase the dose; withdrawal symptoms are unusual. <strong>Lysergide</strong> (lysergic acid diethylamide, LSD) is a much more potent hallucinogen; its use can lead to severe psychotic states which can be life-threatening.</p><p>There are concerns over increases in the availability and misuse of other drugs with variously combined hallucinogenic, anaesthetic, or sedative properties. These include ketamine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (sodium oxybate, GHB).</p></div><div><h2>Supervised consumption</h2><p>Individuals prescribed opioid substitution therapy (<a title="BNF:monograph-family: Opioid substitution therapy" href="PHP3211-opioid-substitution-therapy.htm">section 4.10.3</a>) can take their daily dose under the supervision of a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist during the dose stabilisation phase (usually the first 3 months of treatment), after a relapse or period of instability, or if there is a significant increase in the dose of methadone. Supervised consumption should continue (in accordance with local protocols) until the prescriber is confident that the patient is compliant with their treatment.</p></div><div><h2>Prescribing drugs likely to cause dependence or misuse</h2><p>The prescriber has three main responsibilities:</p><ul><li><p>To avoid creating dependence by introducing drugs to patients without sufficient reason. In this context, the proper use of the morphine-like drugs is well understood. The dangers of other Controlled Drugs are less clear because recognition of dependence is not easy and its effects, and those of withdrawal, are less obvious.</p> </li><li><p>To see that the patient does not gradually increase the dose of a drug, given for good medical reasons, to the point where dependence becomes more likely. This tendency is seen especially with hypnotics and anxiolytics (for CSM advice see <a title=" Hypnotics and anxiolytics" href="PHP2093-hypnotics-and-anxiolytics.htm">section 4.1</a>). The prescriber should keep a close eye on the amount prescribed to prevent patients from accumulating stocks. A minimal amount should be prescribed in the first instance, or when seeing a new patient for the first time.</p> </li><li><p>To avoid being used as an unwitting source of supply for addicts. Methods include visiting more than one doctor, fabricating stories, and forging prescriptions.</p> </li></ul><p>Patients under temporary care should be given only small supplies of drugs unless they present an unequivocal letter from their own doctor. Doctors should also remember that their own patients may be attempting to collect prescriptions from other prescribers, especially in hospitals. It is sensible to reduce dosages steadily or to issue weekly or even daily prescriptions for small amounts if it is apparent that dependence is occurring.</p><p>The stealing and misuse of prescription forms could be minimised by the following precautions:</p><ul><li><p>do not leave unattended if called away from the consulting room or at reception desks; do not leave in a car where they may be visible; when not in use, keep in a locked drawer within the surgery and at home;</p> </li><li><p>draw a diagonal line across the blank part of the form under the prescription;</p> </li><li><p>write the quantity in words and figures when prescribing drugs prone to abuse; this is obligatory for controlled drugs (see Prescriptions, above);</p> </li><li><p>alterations are best avoided but if any are made they should be clear and unambiguous; add initials against altered items;</p> </li><li><p>if prescriptions are left for collection they should be left in a safe place in a sealed envelope.</p> </li></ul></div><div><h2>Travelling abroad</h2><p>Prescribed drugs listed in Schedule 4 Part II (CD Anab) and Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 are not subject to export or import licensing. However, patients intending to travel abroad for more than 3 months carrying any amount of drugs listed in Schedules 2, 3, or 4 Part I (CD Benz) will require a personal export/import licence. Further details can be obtained at <br /><a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/licensing/personal">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/licensing/personal</a>,<br /> or from the Home Office by contacting licensing_enquiry.aadu@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk (in cases of emergency, telephone (020) 7035 6330).</p><p>Applications must be supported by a covering letter from the prescriber and should give details of:</p><ul><li><p>the patient's name and address; </p> </li><li><p>the quantities of drugs to be carried; </p> </li><li><p>the strength and form in which the drugs will be dispensed;</p> </li><li><p>the country or countries of destination;</p> </li><li><p>the dates of travel to and from the United Kingdom.</p> </li></ul><p>Applications for licences should be sent to the Home Office, Drugs Licensing, Peel Building, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF. Alternatively, completed application forms can be emailed to licensing_enquiry.aadu@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk with a scanned copy of the covering letter from the prescriber. A minimum of two weeks should be allowed for processing the application.</p><p>Patients travelling for less than 3 months do not require a personal export/import licence for carrying Controlled Drugs, but are advised to carry a letter from the prescribing doctor. Those travelling for more than 3 months are advised to make arrangements to have their medication prescribed by a practitioner in the country they are visiting.</p><p>Doctors who want to take Controlled Drugs abroad while accompanying patients may similarly be issued with licences. Licences are not normally issued to doctors who want to take Controlled Drugs abroad solely in case a family emergency should arise.</p><p>Personal export/import licences do not have any legal status outside the UK and are issued only to comply with the Misuse of Drugs Act and to facilitate passage through UK Customs and Excise control. For clearance in the country to be visited it is necessary to approach that country's consulate in the UK.</p></div></div><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li><a href="PHP86-notification-of-patients-receiving-structured-drug-treatment-for-substance-dependence.htm" title="Notification of patients receiving structured drug treatment for substance dependence">Notification of patients receiving structured drug treatment for substance dependence</a></li><li><a href="PHP87-prescribing-of-diamorphine-heroin-dipipanone-and-cocaine-for-addicts.htm" title="Prescribing of diamorphine (heroin), dipipanone, and cocaine for addicts">Prescribing of diamorphine (heroin), dipipanone, and cocaine for addicts</a></li></ul></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="PHP78-royal-pharmaceutical-societys-guidelines.htm">Previous: Royal Pharmaceutical Society's guidelines</a> | <a class="top" href="PHP79-controlled-drugs-and-drug-dependence.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="PHP86-notification-of-patients-receiving-structured-drug-treatment-for-substance-dependence.htm">Next: Notification of patients receiving structured drug treatment for substance dependence</a> ►</div><ol class="cC"><li class="footnote" id="ID0EJBCJAA"><p>All preparations in Schedules 2 and 3, except temazepam.</p></li><li class="footnote" id="ID0EHBCJAA"><p>A machine-written prescription is acceptable.
