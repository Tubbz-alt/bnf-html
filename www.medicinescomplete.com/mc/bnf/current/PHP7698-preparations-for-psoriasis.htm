It commonly affects extensor surfaces and the scalp.</p><p>Occasionally, psoriasis is provoked or exacerbated by drugs such as lithium, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, beta-blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and ACE inhibitors. Psoriasis may not be seen until the drug has been taken for weeks or months.</p><p><strong>Emollients</strong> (<a title="sub-section: Emollients" href="PHP7459-emollients.htm">section 13.2.1</a>), in addition to their effects on dryness, scaling and cracking, may have an antiproliferative effect in psoriasis, and may be the only treatment necessary for mild psoriasis. They are particularly useful in <em>inflammatory psoriasis</em> and in <em>plaque psoriasis of palms and soles</em>, in which irritant factors can perpetuate the condition. Emollients are useful adjuncts to other more specific treatment.</p><p>More specific topical treatment for <em>chronic stable plaque psoriasis</em> on extensor surfaces of trunk and limbs involves the use of <strong>vitamin D analogues</strong>, <strong>coal tar</strong>, <strong>dithranol</strong>, and the retinoid <strong>tazarotene</strong>. However, they can irritate the skin and they are not suitable for the more inflammatory forms of psoriasis; their use should be suspended during an inflammatory phase of psoriasis. The efficacy and the irritancy of each substance varies between patients. If a substance irritates significantly, it should be stopped or the concentration reduced; if it is tolerated, its effects should be assessed after 4 to 6 weeks and treatment continued if it is effective.</p><p><em>Scalp psoriasis</em> is usually scaly, and the scale may be thick and adherent; this will require softening with an emollient cream, ointment, or oil. A tar-based shampoo is first-line treatment for scalp psoriasis; a keratolytic, such as salicylic acid, should also be used if there is significant scaling, to allow other treatments to work.</p><p>Some preparations prescribed for psoriasis affecting the scalp, combine salicylic acid with coal tar or sulfur. The product should be applied generously, and an adequate quantity should be prescribed. It should be left on for at least an hour, often more conveniently overnight, before washing off. The use of scalp preparations containing a potent corticosteroid or a vitamin D analogue, either alone or in combination, can also be helpful.</p><p><em>Flexural psoriasis</em> can be managed with short-term use of a mild or moderate potency topical corticosteroid. Calcitriol or tacalcitol can be used in the longer-term; calcipotriol is more likely to cause irritation in flexures and should be avoided. Low strength tar preparations can also be used.</p><p><em>Facial psoriasis</em> can be treated with short-term use of a mild potency topical corticosteroid; if this is ineffective, a corticosteroid of moderate potency, calcitriol, tacalcitol, or a low strength tar preparation can be used.</p><p>Widespread <em>unstable psoriasis</em> of erythrodermic or generalised pustular type requires urgent specialist assessment. Initial topical treatment should be limited to using emollients frequently and generously; emollients should be prescribed in quantities of 1 kg or more. More localised acute or subacute <em>inflammatory psoriasis</em> with hot, spreading or itchy lesions, should be treated topically with emollients or with a corticosteroid of moderate potency. </p><p><strong>Calcipotriol</strong> and <strong>tacalcitol</strong> are analogues of vitamin D that affect cell division and differentiation. <strong>Calcitriol</strong> is an active form of vitamin D. Vitamin D and its analogues are used first-line for the long-term treatment of plaque psoriasis; they do not smell or stain and they may be more acceptable than tar or dithranol products. Of the vitamin D analogues, tacalcitol and calcitriol are less likely to irritate.</p><p><strong>Coal tar</strong> has anti-inflammatory properties that are useful in chronic plaque psoriasis; it also has antiscaling properties. Crude coal tar (coal tar, BP) is the most effective form, typically in a concentration of 1 to 10% in a soft paraffin base, but few outpatients tolerate the smell and mess. Cleaner extracts of coal tar included in proprietary preparations, are more practicable for home use but they are less effective and improvement takes longer. Contact of coal tar products with normal skin is not normally harmful and they can be used for widespread small lesions; however, irritation, contact allergy, and sterile folliculitis can occur. The milder tar extracts can be used on the face and flexures. Tar baths and tar shampoos are also helpful.</p><p><strong>Dithranol</strong> is effective for chronic plaque psoriasis. Its major disadvantages are irritation (for which individual susceptibility varies) and staining of skin and of clothing. It should be applied to chronic extensor plaques only, carefully avoiding normal skin. Dithranol is not generally suitable for widespread small lesions nor should it be used in the flexures or on the face. Treatment should be started with a low concentration such as dithranol 0.1%, and the strength increased gradually every few days up to 3%, according to tolerance. Proprietary preparations are more suitable for home use; they are usually washed off after 5 to 60 minutes (‘short contact’). Specialist nurses may apply intensive treatment with dithranol paste which is covered by stockinette dressings and usually retained overnight. Dithranol should be discontinued if even a low concentration causes acute inflammation; continued use can result in the psoriasis becoming unstable. When applying dithranol, hands should be protected by gloves or they should be washed thoroughly afterwards.</p><p><strong>Tazarotene</strong>, a retinoid, has a similar efficacy to vitamin D and its analogues, but is associated with a greater incidence of irritation. Although irritation is common, it is minimised by applying tazarotene sparingly to the plaques and avoiding normal skin; application to the face and in flexures should also be avoided. Tazarotene does not stain and is odourless.</p><p>A topical <strong>corticosteroid</strong> (<a title="section: Topical corticosteroids" href="PHP7564-topical-corticosteroids.htm">section 13.4</a>) is not generally suitable for long-term use or as the sole treatment of extensive chronic plaque psoriasis; any early improvement is not usually maintained and there is a risk of the condition deteriorating or of precipitating an unstable form of psoriasis (e.g. erythrodermic psoriasis or generalised pustular psoriasis) on withdrawal. Topical use of potent corticosteroids on widespread psoriasis can also lead to systemic as well as local side-effects. However, topical corticosteroids used short-term may be appropriate to treat psoriasis in specific sites such as the face or flexures (with a mild or moderate corticosteroid), and psoriasis of the scalp, palms, and soles (with a potent corticosteroid). Very potent corticosteroids should only be used under specialist supervision.</p><p>Combining the use of a corticosteroid with another specific topical treatment may be beneficial in chronic plaque psoriasis; the drugs may be used separately at different times of the day or used together in a single formulation. <em>Eczema</em> co-existing with psoriasis may be treated with a corticosteroid, or coal tar, or both. </p><div><h2>Phototherapy</h2><p><strong>Phototherapy</strong> is available in specialist centres under the supervision of a dermatologist. <strong>Ultraviolet B</strong> (UVB) radiation is usually effective for <em>chronic stable psoriasis</em> and for <em>guttate psoriasis</em>. It may be considered for patients with moderately severe psoriasis in whom topical treatment has failed, but it may irritate inflammatory psoriasis.</p><p><strong>Photochemotherapy</strong> combining long-wave ultraviolet A radiation with a psoralen (PUVA) is available in specialist centres under the supervision of a dermatologist. The psoralen, which enhances the effect of irradiation, is administered either by mouth or topically. PUVA is effective in most forms of psoriasis, including <em>localised palmoplantar pustular psoriasis</em>. Early adverse effects include phototoxicity and pruritus. Higher cumulative doses exaggerate skin ageing, increase the risk of dysplastic and neoplastic skin lesions, especially squamous cancer, and pose a theoretical risk of cataracts.</p><p>Phototherapy combined with coal tar, dithranol, tazarotene, topical vitamin D or vitamin D analogues, or oral acitretin, allows reduction of the cumulative dose of phototherapy required to treat psoriasis.</p></div><div id="PHP7701"><h2>Systemic treatment</h2><p><strong>Systemic treatment</strong> is required for severe, resistant, unstable or complicated forms of psoriasis, and it should be initiated only under specialist supervision. Systemic drugs for psoriasis include acitretin (see below) and drugs that affect the immune response (such as ciclosporin and methotrexate, <a title="sub-section: Drugs affecting the immune response" href="PHP7766-drugs-affecting-the-immune-response.htm">section 13.5.3</a>).</p><p>Systemic corticosteroids should be used only rarely in psoriasis because rebound deterioration may occur on reducing the dose.</p><p><strong>Acitretin</strong>, a metabolite of etretinate, is a retinoid (vitamin A derivative); it is prescribed by specialists. The main indication for acitretin is <em>psoriasis</em>, but it is also used in disorders of keratinisation such as severe <em>Darier's disease</em> (keratosis follicularis), and some forms of <em>ichthyosis</em>. Although a minority of cases of psoriasis respond well to acitretin alone, it is only moderately effective in many cases and it is combined with other treatments. A therapeutic effect occurs after 2 to 4 weeks and the maximum benefit after 4 to 6 weeks or longer. The manufacturers of acitretin do not recommend continuous treatment for longer than 6 months. However, some patients may benefit from longer treatment, provided that the lowest effective dose is used, patients are monitored carefully for adverse effects, and the need for treatment is reviewed regularly.</p>  <p>Apart from teratogenicity, which remains a risk for 3 years after stopping, acitretin is the least toxic systemic treatment for psoriasis; in women with a potential for child-bearing, the possibility of pregnancy must be excluded before treatment and effective contraception must be used during treatment and for at least 3 years afterwards (oral progestogen-only contraceptives not considered effective).</p> </div></div><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li id="_PHP7702-topical-preparations-for-psoriasis"><a href="PHP7702-topical-preparations-for-psoriasis.htm" title="Topical preparations for psoriasis">Topical preparations for psoriasis</a></li><li id="_PHP7756-oral-retinoids-for-psoriasis"><a href="PHP7756-oral-retinoids-for-psoriasis.htm" title="Oral retinoids for psoriasis">Oral retinoids for psoriasis</a></li></ul></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="PHP7695-alitretinoin.htm">Previous: ALITRETINOIN</a> | <a class="top" href="PHP7698-preparations-for-psoriasis.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="PHP7702-topical-preparations-for-psoriasis.htm">Next: Topical preparations for psoriasis</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Cookie and Privacy Policy">Cookie and Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="PHP0-publication-information.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and Pharmaceutical Press 2012.
