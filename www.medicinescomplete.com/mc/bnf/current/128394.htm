the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) but a number of drugs slow or halt disease progression. Drugs
for HIV infection
(antiretrovirals) may be associated with serious side-effects. Although antiretrovirals
increase life expectancy considerably and decrease the risk of complications
associated with premature ageing, mortality and morbidity remain slightly
higher than in uninfected individuals. Treatment should be undertaken
only by those experienced in their use.</p><div class="cAZ"><h2>Principles of treatment</h2> <p class="cAX">Treatment is aimed at
reducing the plasma viral load as much as possible and for as long
as possible; it should be started before the immune system is irreversibly
damaged. The need for early drug treatment should, however, be balanced
against the risk of toxicity. Commitment to treatment and strict adherence
over many years are required; the regimen chosen should take into
account convenience and patient tolerance. The development of drug
resistance is reduced by using a combination of drugs; such combinations
should have synergistic or additive activity while ensuring that their
toxicity is not additive. It is recommended that viral sensitivity
to antiretroviral drugs is established before starting treatment or
before switching drugs if the infection is not responding.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Initiation of treatment</h2> <p class="cAX">The optimum time for initiating
antiretroviral treatment depends primarily on the CD4 cell count;
the plasma viral load and clinical symptoms may also help. The timing
and choice of treatment should also take account of the possible effects
of antiretroviral drugs on factors such as the risk of cardiovascular
events. Treatment includes a combination of drugs known as ‘highly
active antiretroviral therapy’. Treatment is initiated with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitor; the regimens of choice contain <i>either</i> tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz <i>or</i> abacavir, lamivudine, and efavirenz. Regimens containing 2 nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a boosted protease inhibitor are reserved for
patients with resistance to first-line regimens, women wishing to
become pregnant, or patients with psychiatric illness. Patients who
require treatment for both HIV and chronic hepatitis B should be treated
with antivirals active against both diseases (<a title="BNF:sub-sub-section: Chronic hepatitis B" href="217714.htm#_217714">section 5.3.3.1</a>).</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Switching therapy</h2> <p class="cAX">Deterioration of the condition
(including clinical and virological changes) may require a change
in therapy. The choice of an alternative regimen depends on factors
such as the response to previous treatment, tolerance and the possibility
of cross-resistance.</p></div><div id="_128394.1"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Pregnancy</h2> <p class="cAX">Treatment of HIV infection in pregnancy
aims to reduce the risk of toxicity to the fetus (although the teratogenic
potential of most antiretroviral drugs is unknown), to minimise the
viral load and disease progression in the mother, and to prevent transmission
of infection to the neonate. <b>All treatment options require
careful assessment by a specialist</b>. <span>Zidovudine</span> monotherapy reduces transmission of infection to the neonate. However,
combination antiretroviral therapy maximises the chance of preventing
transmission and represents optimal therapy for the mother. Combination
antiretroviral therapy may be associated with a greater risk of preterm
delivery.</p></div></div><div id="_208142"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Breast-feeding</h2> <p class="cAX">Breast-feeding by HIV-positive
mothers may cause HIV infection in the infant and should be avoided.</p></div></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Children</h2> <p class="cAX">HIV disease in children has a different
natural progression to adults. Children infected with HIV should be
managed within a formal paediatric HIV clinical network by specialists
with access to guidelines and information on antiretroviral drugs
for children.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Post-exposure prophylaxis</h2> <p class="cAX">Prophylaxis with antiretroviral
drugs [unlicensed indication] may be appropriate following exposure
to HIV-contaminated material. Immediate expert advice should be sought
in such cases; national guidelines on post-exposure prophylaxis for
healthcare workers have been developed (by the Chief Medical Officer’s
Expert Advisory Group on AIDS, <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk" title="external link">www.dh.gov.uk</a>) and local ones may also be available. Antiretrovirals for prophylaxis
are chosen on the basis of efficacy and potential for toxicity. Prompt
prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs [unlicensed indication] is also
appropriate following potential sexual exposure to HIV; recommendations
have been developed by the British Association for Sexual Health and
HIV, <a href="http://www.bashh.org" title="external link">www.bashh.org</a></p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Drugs for HIV infection</h2> <p class="cAX"><b><span>Zidovudine</span></b>, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
(or ‘nucleoside
analogue’), was the first anti-HIV drug to be introduced. Other nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors include <b><span>abacavir</span></b>, <b><span>didanosine</span></b>, <b><span>emtricitabine</span></b>, <b><span>lamivudine</span></b>, <b><span>stavudine</span></b>, and <b>tenofovir</b>.</p><p>The protease
inhibitors include <b>atazanavir</b>, <b>darunavir</b>, <b><span>fosamprenavir</span></b> (a pro-drug of
amprenavir), <b><span>indinavir</span></b>, <b><span>lopinavir</span></b>, <b><span>nelfinavir</span></b>, <b><span>ritonavir</span></b>, <b><span>saquinavir</span></b>, and <b>tipranavir</b>. Indinavir is
rarely used in the treatment of HIV-infection because it is associated
with nephrolithiasis. Ritonavir in low doses boosts the activity of
atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir,
and tipranavir increasing the persistence of plasma concentrations
of these drugs; at such a low dose, ritonavir has no intrinsic antiviral
activity. A combination of lopinavir with low-dose ritonavir is available.
The protease inhibitors are metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme
systems and therefore have a significant potential for drug interactions.
Protease inhibitors are associated with lipodystrophy and metabolic
effects (see below).</p><p>The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors <b><span>efavirenz</span></b>, <b>etravirine</b>, and <b><span>nevirapine</span></b> are active against the subtype HIV-1
but not HIV-2, a subtype that is rare in the UK. These drugs may interact
with a number of drugs metabolised in the liver. <span>Nevirapine</span> is associated with a high incidence of rash (including Stevens-Johnson
syndrome) and occasionally fatal hepatitis. Rash is also associated
with <span>efavirenz</span> and etravirine but it is usually
milder. Psychiatric or CNS disturbances are common with efavirenz.
CNS disturbances are often self-limiting and can be reduced by taking
the dose at bedtime (especially in the first 2–4 weeks of treatment). <span>Efavirenz</span> has also been associated with an increased plasma
cholesterol concentration. Etravirine is used in regimens containing
a boosted protease inhibitor for HIV infection resistant to other
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors.</p><p><b><span>Enfuvirtide</span></b>, which inhibits the fusion of HIV
to the host cell, is licensed for managing infection that has failed
to respond to a regimen of other antiretroviral drugs; <span>enfuvirtide</span> should be combined with other potentially active antiretroviral
drugs.</p><p><b>Maraviroc</b> is an antagonist of the CCR5 chemokine receptor. It is licensed
for patients exclusively infected with CCR5-tropic HIV. The <a title="target-block: NICE and Scottish Medicines Consortium" href="29404.htm#_200790"><i>Scottish Medicines
Consortium</i></a> has advised (March 2008) that maraviroc (<span class="cZ">Celsentri</span>®) is <b>not</b> recommended for use within NHS Scotland.</p><p><b>Raltegravir</b> is an inhibitor of HIV integrase. It is licensed for the treatment
of HIV infection in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. The <a title="target-block: NICE and Scottish Medicines Consortium" href="29404.htm#_200790"><i>Scottish Medicines
Consortium</i></a> has advised (April 2010) that raltegravir (<span class="cZ">Isentress</span>®) is accepted for restricted use within NHS Scotland for the treatment
of HIV infection when non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
or protease inhibitors cannot be used because of intolerance, drug
interactions, or resistance.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Immune reconstitution syndrome</h2> <p class="cAX">Improvement in
immune function as a result of antiretroviral treatment may provoke
a marked inflammatory reaction against residual opportunistic organisms.</p></div><div id="_128394.3"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Lipodystrophy syndrome</h2> <p class="cAX"> Metabolic effects associated
with antiretroviral treatment include <i>fat redistribution</i>, <i>insulin resistance</i>, and <i>dyslipidaemia</i>; collectively these have been termed <i>lipodystrophy syndrome</i>. The usual risk factors for cardiovascular disease
should be taken into account before starting antiretroviral therapy and patients should be advised about lifestyle changes
to reduce their cardiovascular risk. Plasma
lipids and blood glucose should be measured before starting antiretroviral
therapy, after 3–6 months of treatment, and then annually.</p><p>Fat redistribution (with loss of subcutaneous fat, increased
abdominal fat, ‘buffalo hump’ and breast enlargement) is associated
with regimens containing protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors. Stavudine (especially in combination with
didanosine), and to a lesser extent zidovudine, are associated with
a higher risk of lipoatrophy and should be used only if alternative
regimens are not suitable.</p><p>Dyslipidaemia is associated with antiretroviral treatment, particularly
with protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors and some nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors are associated with insulin resistance
and hyperglycaemia. Of the protease inhibitors, atazanavir and darunavir
may be less likely to cause dyslipidaemia, while saquinavir and atazanavir
may be less likely to impair glucose tolerance.</p></div></div><div id="_128394.5"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Osteonecrosis</h2> <p class="cAX">Osteonecrosis has been reported
in patients with advanced HIV disease or following long-term exposure
to combination antiretroviral therapy.</p></div></div></div></div><?highlighter on?><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li id="_57048"><a href="57048.htm" title="Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors">Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</a></li><li id="_57097"><a href="57097.htm" title="Protease inhibitors">Protease inhibitors</a></li><li id="_69472"><a href="69472.htm" title="Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors">Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</a></li><li id="_128189"><a href="128189.htm" title="Other antiretrovirals">Other antiretrovirals</a></li></ul></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="3992.htm">Previous: 5.3 Antiviral drugs</a> | <a class="top" href="128394.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="57048.htm">Next: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="35091.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain 2012.
