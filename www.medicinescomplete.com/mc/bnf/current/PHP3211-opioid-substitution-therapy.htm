Substitute medication should be commenced with a short period of stabilisation, followed by either a withdrawal regimen or by maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment enables patients to achieve stability, reduces drug use and crime, and improves health; it should be regularly reviewed to ensure the patient continues to derive benefit. The prescriber should monitor for signs of toxicity, and the patient should be told to be aware of warning signs of toxicity on initiation and during titration.</p> <p>A withdrawal regimen after stabilisation with methadone or buprenorphine should be attempted only after careful consideration. Enforced withdrawal is ineffective for sustained abstinence, and it increases the risk of patients relapsing and subsequently overdosing because of loss of tolerance. Complete withdrawal from opioids usually takes up to 4 weeks in an inpatient or residential setting, and up to 12 weeks in a community setting. If abstinence is not achieved, illicit drug use is resumed, or the patient cannot tolerate withdrawal, the withdrawal regimen should be stopped and maintenance therapy should be resumed at the optimal dose. Following successful withdrawal treatment, further support and monitoring to maintain abstinence should be provided for a period of at least 6 months.</p> <p>In younger patients (under 18 years), the harmful effects of drug misuse are more often related to acute intoxication than to dependence, so substitution therapy is usually inappropriate. Maintenance treatment with opioid substitution therapy is therefore controversial in young people; however, it may be useful for the older adolescent who has a history of opioid use to undergo a period of stabilisation with buprenorphine or methadone before starting a withdrawal regimen.</p> <div class="cI"><h3 class="cT">Missed doses</h3><p>Patients who miss 3 days or more of their regular prescribed dose of opioid maintenance therapy are at risk of overdose because of loss of tolerance. Consider reducing the dose in these patients.</p><p>If the patient misses 5 or more days of treatment, an assessment of illicit drug use is also recommended before restarting substitution therapy; this is particularly important for patients taking buprenorphine, because of the risk of precipitated withdrawal.</p></div> <div class="cI"><p class="cAE">NICE guidance</p><h3 class="cT">Methadone and buprenorphine for the management of opioid dependence (January 2007)</h3><p>Oral methadone and buprenorphine are recommended for maintenance therapy in the management of opioid dependence. Patients should be committed to a supportive care programme including a flexible dosing regimen administered under supervision for at least 3 months, until compliance is assured. Selection of methadone or buprenorphine should be made on a case-by-case basis, but methadone should be prescribed if both drugs are equally suitable.</p></div> <div id="PHP3213"><h2>Buprenorphine</h2><p>Buprenorphine is an opioid-receptor partial agonist (it has opioid agonist and antagonist properties). Buprenorphine is preferred by some patients because it is less sedating than methadone; for this reason it may be more suitable for employed patients or those undertaking other skilled tasks such as driving. Buprenorphine is safer than methadone when used in conjunction with other sedating drugs, and has fewer drug interactions. Dose reductions may be easier than with methadone because the withdrawal symptoms are milder, and patients generally require fewer adjunctive medications; there is also a lower risk of overdose. Buprenorphine can be given on alternate days in higher doses and it requires a shorter drug-free period than methadone before induction with <a title="BNF:monograph: NALTREXONE HYDROCHLORIDE" href="PHP3233-naltrexone-hydrochloride.htm">naltrexone</a> for prevention of relapse.</p><p>Patients dependent on high doses of opioids may be at increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Precipitated withdrawal can occur in any patient if buprenorphine is administered when other opioid agonist drugs are in circulation. Precipitated opioid withdrawal, if it occurs, starts within 1–3 hours of the first buprenorphine dose and peaks at around 6 hours. Non-opioid adjunctive therapy, such as <a title="BNF:target-block: Lofexidine notes" href="PHP3228-adjunctive-therapy-and-symptomatic-treatment.htm#PHP3229">lofexidine</a>, may be required if symptoms are severe.</p><p>To reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal, the first dose of buprenorphine should be given when the patient is exhibiting signs of withdrawal, <em>or</em> 6–12 hours after the last use of heroin (or other short-acting opioid), <em>or</em> 24–48 hours after the last dose of methadone. It is possible to titrate the dose of buprenorphine within one week—more rapidly than with methadone therapy—but care is still needed to avoid toxicity or precipitated withdrawal; dividing the dose on the first day may be useful.</p><p>In patients taking methadone who want to switch to buprenorphine, the dose of methadone should be reduced to a maximum of 30 mg daily before starting buprenorphine treatment. If the dose of methadone is over 10 mg daily, buprenorphine can be started at a dose of 4 mg daily and titrated according to requirements; if the methadone dose is below 10 mg daily, buprenorphine can be started at a dose of 2 mg daily.</p><p>Buprenorphine should not normally be used in patients with liver dysfunction. Baseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status is recommended before commencing therapy, and regular liver function tests should be performed throughout treatment.</p><p>A combination preparation containing buprenorphine with naloxone (<a title="BNF:preparation: Suboxone®" href="PHP3224-suboxone.htm#PHP3224-suboxone"><em>Suboxone</em></a>®) can be prescribed for patients when there is a risk of dose diversion for parenteral administration; the naloxone component precipitates withdrawal if the preparation is injected, but it has little effect when the preparation is taken sublingually.</p></div> <div id="PHP3214"><h2>Methadone</h2><p>Methadone, a long-acting opioid agonist, is usually administered in a single daily dose as methadone oral solution 1 mg/mL. Patients with a long history of opioid misuse, those who typically abuse a variety of sedative drugs and alcohol, and those who experience increased anxiety during withdrawal of opioids may prefer methadone to buprenorphine because it has a more pronounced sedative effect.</p><p>Methadone is initiated at least 8 hours after the last heroin dose, provided that there is objective evidence of withdrawal symptoms. A supplementary dose on the first day may be considered if there is evidence of persistent opioid withdrawal symptoms. Because of the long half-life, plasma concentrations progressively rise during initial treatment even if the patient remains on the same daily dose (it takes 3–10 days for plasma concentrations to reach steady-state in patients on a stable dose); a dose tolerated on the first day of treatment may become a toxic dose on the third day as cumulative toxicity develops. Thus, titration to the optimal dose in methadone maintenance treatment may take several weeks. </p></div> <div id="PHP3215"><h2>Pregnancy</h2><p>Acute withdrawal of opioids should be avoided in pregnancy because it can cause fetal death. Opioid substitution therapy is recommended during pregnancy because it carries a lower risk to the fetus than continued use of illicit drugs. If a woman who is stabilised on methadone or buprenorphine for treatment of opioid dependence becomes pregnant, therapy should be continued [buprenorphine is not licensed for use in pregnancy]. Many pregnant patients choose a withdrawal regimen, but withdrawal during the first trimester should be avoided because it is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage. Withdrawal of methadone or buprenorphine should be undertaken gradually during the second trimester; for example, the dose of methadone may be reduced by 2–3 mg every 3–5 days. If illicit drug use occurs, the patient should be re-stabilised at the optimal maintenance dose and consideration should be given to stopping the withdrawal regimen.</p><p>Further withdrawal of methadone or buprenorphine in the third trimester is not recommended because maternal withdrawal, even if mild, is associated with fetal distress, stillbirth, and the risk of neonatal mortality. Drug metabolism can be increased in the third trimester; it may be necessary to either increase the dose of methadone or change to twice-daily consumption (or a combination of both strategies) to prevent withdrawal symptoms from developing.</p><p>The neonate should be monitored for respiratory depression and signs of withdrawal if the mother is prescribed high doses of opioid substitute.</p><p>Signs of neonatal withdrawal from opioids usually develop 24–72 hours after delivery but symptoms may be delayed for up to 14 days, so monitoring may be required for several weeks. Symptoms include a high-pitched cry, rapid breathing, hungry but ineffective suckling, and excessive wakefulness; severe, but rare symptoms include hypertonicity and convulsions.</p></div> <div id="PHP3216"><h2>Breast-feeding </h2><p>The dose of methadone should be kept as low as possible in breast-feeding mothers and the infant should be monitored for sedation (high doses of methadone carry an increased risk of sedation and respiratory depression in the neonate).</p><p>Buprenorphine is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk and has low oral bioavailability; however, neonates should be monitored for drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones.</p><p>Increased sleepiness, breathing difficulties, or limpness in breast-fed babies of mothers taking opioid substitutes should be reported urgently to a healthcare professional.</p></div> </div><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li id="_PHP3217-buprenorphine"><a href="PHP3217-buprenorphine.htm" title="BUPRENORPHINE">BUPRENORPHINE</a></li><li id="_PHP3223-buprenorphine-with-naloxone"><a href="PHP3223-buprenorphine-with-naloxone.htm" title="BUPRENORPHINE WITH NALOXONE">BUPRENORPHINE WITH NALOXONE</a></li><li id="_PHP3225-methadone-hydrochloride"><a href="PHP3225-methadone-hydrochloride.htm" title="METHADONE HYDROCHLORIDE">METHADONE HYDROCHLORIDE</a></li></ul></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="PHP3210-opioid-dependence.htm">Previous: 4.10.3 Opioid dependence</a> | <a class="top" href="PHP3211-opioid-substitution-therapy.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="PHP3217-buprenorphine.htm">Next: BUPRENORPHINE</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Cookie and Privacy Policy">Cookie and Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="PHP0-publication-information.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and Pharmaceutical Press 2012.
