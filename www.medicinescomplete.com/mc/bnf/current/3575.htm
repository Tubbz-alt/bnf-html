object of treatment is to prevent the occurrence of seizures by maintaining
an effective dose of one or more antiepileptic drugs. Careful
adjustment of doses is necessary, starting with low doses and increasing
gradually until seizures are controlled or there are significant adverse
effects.</p><p>When choosing an antiepileptic drug, the seizure type, epilepsy
syndrome, concomitant medication, co-morbidity, age, and sex should
be taken into account. For women of child-bearing age, see <a title="target-block: Pregnancy and breast-feeding in epilepsy" href="3575.htm#_120546">Pregnancy</a> and <a title="BNF:target-block: breast-feeding control of epilepsy" href="3575.htm#_207526">Breast-feeding</a>.</p><p>The dosage frequency is often determined by the plasma-drug
half-life, and should be kept as low as possible to encourage adherence
with the prescribed regimen. Most antiepileptics, when used in the
usual dosage, can be given twice daily. Lamotrigine, phenobarbital,
and phenytoin, which have long half-lives, can be given once daily
at bedtime. However, with large doses, some antiepileptics may need
to be given more frequently to avoid adverse effects associated with
high peak plasma-drug concentration. Young children metabolise some
antiepileptics more rapidly than adults and therefore may require
more frequent doses and a higher dose in proportion to their body-weight.</p><div class="cAZ"><h2>Management</h2> <p class="cAX">When monotherapy with a first-line
antiepileptic drug has failed, monotherapy with a second drug should
be tried; the diagnosis should be checked before starting an alternative
drug if the first drug showed lack of efficacy. The change from one
antiepileptic drug to another should be cautious, slowly withdrawing
the first drug only when the new regimen has been established. Combination
therapy with two or more antiepileptic drugs may be necessary, but
the concurrent use of antiepileptic drugs increases the risk of adverse
effects and drug interactions (see below). If combination therapy
does not bring about worthwhile benefits, revert to the regimen (monotherapy
or combination therapy) that provided the best balance between tolerability
and efficacy.</p></div><div id="_120547"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Interactions</h2> <p class="cAX">Interactions between antiepileptics
are complex and may increase toxicity without a corresponding increase
in antiepileptic effect. Interactions are usually caused by hepatic
enzyme induction or inhibition; displacement from protein binding
sites is not usually a problem. These interactions are highly variable
and unpredictable.</p><p>For interactions of antiepileptic drugs, see <b>Appendix
1</b>; for advice on hormonal contraception and enzyme-inducing
drugs, see <a title="BNF:target-block: COCs interactions" href="4552.htm#_120026">section 7.3.1</a> and <a title="BNF:sub-section: Progestogen-only contraceptives" href="4571.htm#_4571">section 7.3.2</a>.</p><p>Significant interactions that occur <b>between antiepileptics</b> and that may affect dosing requirements are as follows:</p><div class="cN"><div class="cAR"><h3>Note</h3> <p class="cAX">Check under each drug for possible interactions

specialist supervision. Avoid abrupt withdrawal, particularly of <span>barbiturates</span> and benzodiazepines, because this can precipitate
severe rebound seizures. Reduction in dosage should be gradual and,
in the case of <span>barbiturates</span>, withdrawal of the
drug may take months.</p><p>The decision to withdraw antiepileptic drugs from a seizure-free
patient, and its timing, is often difficult and depends on individual
circumstances. Even in patients who have been seizure-free for several
years, there is a significant risk of seizure recurrence on drug withdrawal.</p><p>In patients receiving several antiepileptic drugs, only one
drug should be withdrawn at a time.</p></div><div id="_219197"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Antiepileptic hypersensitivity syndrome</h2> <p class="cAX">Antiepileptic
hypersensitivity syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal syndrome
associated with some antiepileptic drugs (<b>carbamazepine</b>, <b>lacosamide</b>, <b>lamotrigine</b>, <b>oxcarbazepine</b>, <b>phenobarbital</b>, <b>phenytoin</b>, <b>primidone</b>, and <b>rufinamide</b>); rarely
cross-sensitivity occurs between some of these antiepileptic drugs.
Some other antiepileptics (<b>eslicarbazepine</b>, <b>stiripentol</b>, and <b>zonisamide</b>) have a theoretical
risk. The symptoms usually start between 1 and 8 weeks of exposure;
fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy are most commonly seen. Other systemic
signs include liver dysfunction, haematological, renal, and pulmonary
abnormalities, vasculitis, and multi-organ failure. If signs or symptoms
of hypersensitivity syndrome occur, the drug should be withdrawn immediately,
the patient must not be re-exposed, and expert advice should be sought.</p></div></div><div id="_200951"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Driving</h2> <p class="cAX">Patients with epilepsy may drive a motor vehicle (but not a
large goods or passenger carrying vehicle) provided that they have
been seizure-free for one year or, if subject to attacks only while
asleep, have established a 3-year period of asleep attacks without
awake attacks. Those affected by drowsiness should not drive or operate
machinery.</p><p>Guidance issued by the Drivers Medical Unit of the Driver and
Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) recommends that patients should be
advised not to drive during medication changes or withdrawal of antiepileptic
drugs, and for 6 months afterwards (see also <a title="target-block: DRUGS AND DRIVING" href="29404.htm#_120507">Drugs and Driving</a> under General Guidance).</p><p>Patients who have had a first or single epileptic seizure must
not drive for 6 months (5 years in the case of large goods or passenger
carrying vehicles) after the event; driving may then be resumed, provided
the patient has been assessed by a specialist as fit to drive because
no abnormality was detected on investigation.</p></div></div><div id="_120546"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Pregnancy</h2> <p class="cAX">Women of child-bearing potential should discuss with a specialist
the impact of both epilepsy, and its treatment, on the outcome of
pregnancy.</p><p>There is an increased risk of teratogenicity associated with
the use of antiepileptic drugs (especially if used during the first
trimester and particularly if the patient takes two or more antiepileptic
drugs). Valproate is associated with the highest risk of major and
minor congenital malformations, and with developmental delay. Valproate
should not be prescribed unless there is no safer alternative and
only after a careful discussion of the risks; doses greater than 1 g
daily are associated with an increased risk of teratogenicity. There
is also an increased risk of teratogenicity with phenytoin, primidone,
phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine. Topiramate carries
an increased risk of cleft palate if taken in the first trimester
of pregnancy. There is not enough evidence to establish the risk of
teratogenicity with other antiepileptic drugs.</p><p>Prescribers should also consider carefully the choice of antiepileptic
therapy in pre-pubescent girls who may later become pregnant. </p><p>Women of child-bearing potential who take antiepileptic drugs
should be given contraceptive advice. Some antiepileptic drugs can
reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives, and the efficacy of
some antiepileptics may be affected by hormonal contraceptives (see <a title="BNF:target-block: COCs interactions" href="4552.htm#_120026">section 7.3.1</a> and interactions of antiepileptics,
Appendix 1).</p><p>Women who want to become pregnant should be referred to a specialist
for advice in advance of conception. For some women, the severity
of seizure or the seizure type may not pose a serious threat, and
drug withdrawal may be considered; therapy may be resumed after the
first trimester. If treatment with antiepileptic drugs must continue
throughout pregnancy, then monotherapy is preferable at the lowest
effective dose.</p><p>Once an unplanned pregnancy is discovered it is usually too
late for changes to be made to the treatment regimen; the risk of
harm to the mother and fetus from convulsive seizures outweighs the
risk of continued therapy. The likelihood of a woman who is taking
antiepileptic drugs having a baby with no malformations is at least
90%, and it is important that women do not stop taking essential treatment
because of concern over harm to the fetus.</p><p>To reduce the risk of neural tube defects, folate supplementation
(<a title="BNF:target-block: neural tube defects" href="4901.htm#_120004">section 9.1.2</a>) is advised before conception
and throughout the first trimester.</p><p> The concentration of antiepileptic drugs in the plasma can
change during pregnancy. Doses of <a title="BNF:monograph: PHENYTOIN" href="3595.htm#_3595">phenytoin</a> , carbamazepine, and lamotrigine should
be adjusted on the basis of plasma-drug concentration monitoring;
the dose of other antiepileptic drugs should be monitored carefully
during pregnancy and after birth, and adjustments made on a clinical
basis. Plasma-drug concentration monitoring during pregnancy is also
useful to check compliance. Additionally, in patients taking topiramate
or levetiracetam, it is recommended that fetal growth should be monitored.</p><p> Women who have seizures in the second half of pregnancy should
be assessed for eclampsia before any change is made to antiepileptic
treatment. Status epilepticus should be treated according to the standard
protocol, see <a title="BNF:sub-section: Drugs used in status epilepticus" href="3617.htm#_3617">section 4.8.2</a>.</p><p> Routine injection of vitamin K (<a title="BNF:sub-section: Vitamin K" href="5149.htm#_5149">section 9.6.6</a>) at birth minimises the risk
of neonatal haemorrhage associated with antiepileptics.</p><p> Withdrawal effects in the newborn may occur with some antiepileptic
drugs, in particular benzodiazepines and phenobarbital.</p><div class="cN"><h3 class="cBP">Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register</h3><p>All pregnant women with epilepsy, whether taking medication
or not, should be encouraged to notify the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy
Register (Tel: 0800 389 1248).</p></div></div></div><div id="_207526"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Breast-feeding</h2> <p class="cAX">Women taking antiepileptic monotherapy should generally be encouraged
to breast-feed; if a woman is on combination therapy or if there are
other risk factors, such as premature birth, specialist advice should
be sought.</p><p>All infants should be monitored for sedation, feeding difficulties,
adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones. Infants should
also be monitored for adverse effects associated with the antiepileptic
drug particularly with newer antiepileptics, if the antiepileptic
is readily transferred into breast-milk causing high infant serum-drug
concentrations (e.g. ethosuximide, lamotrigine, primidone, and zonisamide),
or if slower metabolism in the infant causes drugs to accumulate (e.g.
phenobarbital and lamotrigine). Serum-drug concentration monitoring
should be undertaken in breast-fed infants if suspected adverse reactions
develop; if toxicity develops it may be necessary to introduce formula
feeds to limit the infant’s drug exposure, or to wean the infant off
breast-milk altogether.</p><p>Primidone, phenobarbital, and the benzodiazepines are associated
with an established risk of drowsiness in breast-fed babies and caution
is required.</p><p>Withdrawal effects may occur in infants if a mother suddenly
stops breast-feeding, particularly if she is taking phenobarbital,
primidone, or lamotrigine.</p></div></div></div></div><?highlighter on?><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li><a href="9805.htm" title="Focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation">Focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation</a></li><li><a href="9808.htm" title="Generalised seizures">Generalised seizures</a></li><li><a href="202444.htm" title="Epilepsy syndromes">Epilepsy syndromes</a></li><li id="_3576"><a href="3576.htm" title="Carbamazepine and related antiepileptics">Carbamazepine and related antiepileptics</a></li><li id="_3581"><a href="3581.htm" title="Ethosuximide">Ethosuximide</a></li><li id="_89413"><a href="89413.htm" title="Gabapentin and pregabalin">Gabapentin and pregabalin</a></li><li id="_201442"><a href="201442.htm" title="Lacosamide">Lacosamide</a></li><li id="_9827"><a href="9827.htm" title="Lamotrigine">Lamotrigine</a></li><li id="_89415"><a href="89415.htm" title="Levetiracetam">Levetiracetam</a></li><li id="_3585"><a href="3585.htm" title="Phenobarbital and primidone">Phenobarbital and primidone</a></li><li id="_3594"><a href="3594.htm" title="Phenytoin">Phenytoin</a></li><li id="_214614"><a href="214614.htm" title="Retigabine">Retigabine</a></li><li id="_200113"><a href="200113.htm" title="Rufinamide">Rufinamide</a></li><li id="_106093"><a href="106093.htm" title="Tiagabine">Tiagabine</a></li><li id="_89426"><a href="89426.htm" title="Topiramate">Topiramate</a></li><li id="_3598"><a href="3598.htm" title="Valproate">Valproate</a></li><li id="_32298"><a href="32298.htm" title="Vigabatrin">Vigabatrin</a></li><li id="_129257"><a href="129257.htm" title="Zonisamide">Zonisamide</a></li><li id="_3605"><a href="3605.htm" title="Benzodiazepines">Benzodiazepines</a></li><li><a href="3609.htm" title="Other drugs">Other drugs</a></li></ul></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="3574.htm">Previous: 4.8 Antiepileptic drugs</a> | <a class="top" href="3575.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="9805.htm">Next: Focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="35091.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain 2012.
