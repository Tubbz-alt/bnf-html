If they are particularly troublesome, beta-blockers are sometimes effective and may be safer than other suppressant drugs.</p></div><div id="PHP894"><h2>Atrial fibrillation</h2><p>All patients with atrial fibrillation should be assessed for their risk of stroke and thromboembolism, and thromboprophylaxis given if necessary (see below). Atrial fibrillation can be managed by either controlling the ventricular rate or by attempting to restore and maintain sinus rhythm. </p><p>All haemodynamically unstable patients with acute-onset atrial fibrillation should undergo electrical cardioversion. Intravenous amiodarone, or alternatively flecainide, can be used in non-life-threatening cases when electrical cardioversion is delayed. If urgent ventricular rate control is required, a beta-blocker, verapamil, or amiodarone can be given intravenously.</p><p>In haemodynamically stable patients, a rhythm-control treatment strategy is preferred for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; rate-control is preferred for those with permanent atrial fibrillation. For patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, the treatment strategy should be based on criteria such as age, co-morbidities, presence of symptoms, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of each treatment.</p><p>Ventricular rate can be controlled with a beta-blocker (<a title="target-block: beta-blockers and arrhythmias" href="PHP934-beta-adrenoceptor-blocking-drugs.htm#PHP941">section 2.4</a>), or diltiazem [unlicensed indication], or verapamil. Digoxin is usually only effective for controlling the ventricular rate at rest, and should therefore only be used as monotherapy in predominantly sedentary patients. When a single drug fails to adequately control the ventricular rate, patients should receive digoxin with either a beta-blocker, diltiazem, or verapamil. If ventricular function is diminished, the combination of a beta-blocker (that is licensed for use in heart failure) and digoxin is preferred (see <a title="BNF:topic: Heart failure" href="PHP1123-heart-failure.htm">section 2.5.5</a>, and <strong>interactions</strong>: Appendix 1 (cardiac glycosides)). Digoxin is also used when atrial fibrillation is accompanied by congestive heart failure.</p><p>Sinus rhythm can be restored by electrical cardioversion, or pharmacological cardioversion with an oral or intravenous anti-arrhythmic drug e.g. flecainide or amiodarone. If necessary, sotalol or amiodarone can be started 4 weeks before electrical cardioversion to increase success of the procedure. If atrial fibrillation has been present for more than 48 hours, cardioversion should not be attempted until the patient has been fully anticoagulated (see <a title="BNF:monograph-family: Coumarins and phenindione" href="PHP1485-coumarins-and-phenindione.htm">section 2.8.2</a>) for at least 3 weeks; if this is not possible, parenteral anticoagulation (<a title="BNF:sub-section: Parenteral anticoagulants" href="PHP1441-parenteral-anticoagulants.htm">section 2.8.1</a>) should be commenced and a left atrial thrombus ruled out immediately before cardioversion; oral anticoagulation should be given after cardioversion and continued for at least 4 weeks. For atrial fibrillation of over 48 hours duration, electrical cardioversion is preferred to pharmacological methods. If drug treatment is required to maintain sinus rhythm, a beta-blocker is used. If a standard beta-blocker is not appropriate or is ineffective, an oral anti-arrhythmic drug such as sotalol (<a title="target-block: sotalol in ventricular arrhythmias" href="PHP934-beta-adrenoceptor-blocking-drugs.htm#PHP942">section 2.4</a>), flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone, is required.</p><p>In symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, ventricular rhythm is controlled with a beta-blocker. Alternatively, if symptoms persist or a beta-blocker is not appropriate, an oral anti-arrhythmic drug such as sotalol, flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone can be given (see also Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia below, and <a title="monograph-family: Supraventricular arrhythmias" href="PHP898-supraventricular-arrhythmias.htm">Supraventricular Arrhythmias</a>). In selected patients with infrequent episodes of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sinus rhythm can be restored using the ‘pill-in-the-pocket’ approach; this involves the patient taking oral flecainide or propafenone to self-treat an episode of atrial fibrillation when it occurs.</p><p>All patients with atrial fibrillation should be assessed for their risk of stroke and the need for thromboprophylaxis. Anticoagulants (<a title="section: Anticoagulants and protamine" href="PHP1438-anticoagulants-and-protamine.htm">section 2.8</a>) are indicated for those with a history of ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, or thromboembolic events, and those with valve disease, heart failure, or impaired left ventricular function; anticoagulants should be considered for those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, or thyrotoxicosis, and in the elderly. Anticoagulants are also indicated during cardioversion procedures (see above). Aspirin (<a title="section: Antiplatelet drugs" href="PHP1519-antiplatelet-drugs.htm">section 2.9</a>) is less effective than warfarin at preventing emboli, but may be appropriate if there are no other risk factors for stroke, or if warfarin is contra-indicated.</p></div><div><h2>Atrial flutter</h2><p>Like atrial fibrillation, treatment options for atrial flutter involve either controlling the ventricular rate or attempting to restore and maintain sinus rhythm. However, atrial flutter generally responds less well to drug treatment than atrial fibrillation.</p><p>Control of the ventricular rate is usually an interim measure pending restoration of sinus rhythm. Ventricular rate can be controlled by administration of a beta-blocker (<a title="BNF:section: Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs" href="PHP934-beta-adrenoceptor-blocking-drugs.htm">section 2.4</a>), diltiazem [unlicensed indication], or verapamil (<a title="BNF:monograph: VERAPAMIL HYDROCHLORIDE" href="PHP1372-verapamil-hydrochloride.htm">section 2.6.2</a>); an intravenous beta-blocker or verapamil is preferred for rapid control. Digoxin (<a title="BNF:monograph: DIGOXIN" href="PHP752-digoxin.htm">section 2.1.1</a>) can be added if rate control remains inadequate, and may be particularly useful in those with heart failure.</p><p>Conversion to sinus rhythm can be achieved by electrical cardioversion (by cardiac pacing or direct current), pharmacological cardioversion, or catheter ablation. If the duration of atrial flutter is unknown, or it has lasted for over 48 hours, cardioversion should not be attempted until the patient has been fully anticoagulated (see <a title="BNF:monograph-family: Coumarins and phenindione" href="PHP1485-coumarins-and-phenindione.htm">section 2.8.2</a>) for at least 3 weeks; if this is not possible, parenteral anticoagulation (<a title="BNF:sub-section: Parenteral anticoagulants" href="PHP1441-parenteral-anticoagulants.htm">section 2.8.1</a>) should be commenced and a left atrial thrombus ruled out immediately before cardioversion; oral anticoagulation should be given after cardioversion and continued for at least 4 weeks.</p><p>Direct current cardioversion is usually the treatment of choice when rapid conversion to sinus rhythm is necessary (e.g. when atrial flutter is associated with haemodynamic compromise); catheter ablation is preferred for the treatment of recurrent atrial flutter. There is a limited role for anti-arrhythmic drugs as their use is not always successful. Flecainide or propafenone can slow atrial flutter, resulting in 1:1 conduction to the ventricles, and should therefore be prescribed in conjunction with a ventricular rate controlling drug such as a beta-blocker, diltiazem [unlicensed indication], or verapamil. Amiodarone can be used when other drug treatments are contra-indicated or ineffective.</p><p>All patients should be assessed for their risk of stroke and the need for thromboprophylaxis; the choice of anticoagulant is based on the same criteria as for <a title="BNF:target-block: Atrial fibrillation" href="PHP893-management-of-arrhythmias.htm#PHP894">atrial fibrillation</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia</h2><p>This will often terminate spontaneously or with reflex vagal stimulation such as a Valsalva manoeuvre, immersing the face in ice-cold water, or carotid sinus massage; such manoeuvres should be performed with ECG monitoring.</p><p> If the effects of reflex vagal stimulation are transient or ineffective, or if the arrhythmia is causing severe symptoms, intravenous adenosine (<a title="BNF:monograph: ADENOSINE" href="PHP900-adenosine.htm">section 2.3.2</a>) should be given. If adenosine is ineffective or contra-indicated, intravenous verapamil (<a title="BNF:monograph: VERAPAMIL HYDROCHLORIDE" href="PHP1372-verapamil-hydrochloride.htm">section 2.6.2</a>) is an alternative, but it should be avoided in patients recently treated with beta-blockers (see <a title="target-block: VERAPAMIL AND BETA-BLOCKERS" href="PHP1372-verapamil-hydrochloride.htm#PHP1373">VERAPAMIL</a>).</p><p>Failure to terminate paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia with reflex vagal stimulation or drug treatment may suggest an arrhythmia of atrial origin, such as focal atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter.</p><p>Treatment with direct current cardioversion is needed in haemodynamically unstable patients or when the above measures have failed to restore sinus rhythm (and an alternative diagnosis has not been found).</p><p>Recurrent episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia can be treated by catheter ablation, or prevented with drugs such as diltiazem, verapamil, beta-blockers including sotalol (<a title="BNF:monograph: SOTALOL HYDROCHLORIDE" href="PHP1020-sotalol-hydrochloride.htm">section 2.4</a>), flecainide, or propafenone (<a title="BNF:monograph-family: Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias" href="PHP906-supraventricular-and-ventricular-arrhythmias.htm">section 2.3.2</a>). </p></div><div id="PHP895"><h2>Arrhythmias after myocardial infarction</h2><p>In patients with a paroxysmal tachycardia or rapid irregularity of the pulse it is best not to administer an antiarrhythmic until an ECG record has been obtained. Bradycardia, particularly if complicated by hypotension, should be treated with 500 micrograms of atropine sulfate given intravenously; the dose may be repeated every 3–5 minutes if necessary up to a maximum total dose of 3 mg. If there is a risk of asystole, or if the patient is unstable and has failed to respond to atropine, adrenaline should be given by intravenous infusion in a dose of 2–10 micrograms/minute, adjusted according to response. </p><p>For further advice, refer to the most recent recommendations of the Resuscitation Council (UK) available at <a href="http://www.resus.org.uk">www.resus.org.uk</a>.</p></div><div id="PHP896"><h2>Ventricular tachycardia</h2><p>Pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation should be treated with immediate defibrillation (see Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, <a title="BNF:sub-section: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation" href="PHP1434-cardiopulmonary-resuscitation.htm">section 2.7.3</a>).</p><p>Patients with unstable sustained ventricular tachycardia, who continue to deteriorate with signs of hypotension or reduced cardiac output, should receive direct current cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm. If this fails, intravenous amiodarone (<a title="BNF:monograph: AMIODARONE HYDROCHLORIDE" href="PHP908-amiodarone-hydrochloride.htm">section 2.3.2</a>) should be administered and direct current cardioversion repeated.</p><p>Patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia who are haemodynamically stable can be treated with intravenous anti-arrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone is the preferred drug. Flecainide, propafenone (<a title="BNF:monograph-family: Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias" href="PHP906-supraventricular-and-ventricular-arrhythmias.htm">section 2.3.2</a>), and, although less effective, lidocaine (<a title="BNF:monograph: LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE" href="PHP928-lidocaine-hydrochloride.htm">section 2.3.2</a>) have all been used. If sinus rhythm is not restored, direct current cardioversion or pacing should be considered. Catheter ablation is an alternative if cessation of the arrhythmia is not urgent. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia can be treated with a beta-blocker (<a title="BNF:section: Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs" href="PHP934-beta-adrenoceptor-blocking-drugs.htm">section 2.4</a>).</p><p>All patients presenting with ventricular tachycardia should be referred to a specialist. Following restoration of sinus rhythm, patients who remain at high risk of cardiac arrest will require maintenance therapy. Most patients will be treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Beta-blockers or sotalol (in place of a standard beta-blocker), or amiodarone (in combination with a standard beta-blocker), can be used in addition to the device in some patients; alternatively, they can be used alone when use of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is not appropriate.</p><p><em>Torsade de pointes</em> is a form of ventricular tachycardia associated with a long QT syndrome (usually drug-induced, but other factors including hypokalaemia, severe bradycardia, and genetic predisposition are also implicated). Episodes are usually self-limiting, but are frequently recurrent and can cause impairment or loss of consciousness. If not controlled, the arrhythmia can progress to ventricular fibrillation and sometimes death. Intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate (<a title=" Magnesium" href="PHP6109-magnesium.htm">section 9.5.1.3</a>) is usually effective. A beta-blocker (but not sotalol) and atrial (or ventricular) pacing can be considered. Anti-arrhythmics can further prolong the QT interval, thus worsening the condition.</p></div></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="PHP892-anti-arrhythmic-drugs.htm">Previous: 2.3 Anti-arrhythmic drugs</a> | <a class="top" href="PHP893-management-of-arrhythmias.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="PHP897-drugs-for-arrhythmias.htm">Next: 2.3.2 Drugs for arrhythmias</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Cookie and Privacy Policy">Cookie and Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="PHP0-publication-information.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and Pharmaceutical Press 2012.
