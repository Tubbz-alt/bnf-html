whilst side-effects characteristic of a particular drug or class of
drugs (e.g. neurotoxicity with vinca alkaloids) are mentioned in the
appropriate sections. Manufacturers’ product literature, hospital-trust
protocols, and cancer-network protocols should be consulted for full
details of side-effects associated with individual drugs and specific
chemotherapy regimes.</p><p>Many side-effects of cytotoxic drugs often do not occur at the
time of administration, but days or weeks later. It is therefore important
that patients and healthcare professionals can identify symptoms that
cause concern and can contact an expert for advice. Toxicities should
be accurately recorded using a recognised scoring system such as the
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) developed by the
National Cancer Institute.   </p><div class="cAZ"><h2>Extravasation of intravenous drugs</h2> <p class="cAX">A number of
cytotoxic drugs will cause severe local tissue necrosis if leakage
into the extravascular compartment occurs. <span id="_100100.3">To reduce the risk of extravasation
injury it is recommended that cytotoxic drugs are administered by
appropriately trained staff. For information on the prevention and management
of extravasation injury, see <a title="BNF:topic: Extravasation" href="100049.htm#_100049">section 10.3</a>.</span></p></div><div class="cAZ" id="_100100.4"><h2>Oral mucositis</h2> <p class="cAX">A sore mouth is a common complication
of cancer chemotherapy; it is most often associated with fluorouracil,
methotrexate, and the anthracyclines. It is best to prevent the complication. Good oral hygiene (rinsing the mouth frequently
and effective brushing of the teeth with a soft brush 2–3 times daily)
is probably beneficial. For fluorouracil, sucking ice chips during
short infusions of the drug is also helpful.</p><p>Once a sore mouth has developed, treatment is much less effective.
Saline mouthwashes should be used but there is no good evidence to
support the use of antiseptic or anti-inflammatory mouthwashes. In
general, mucositis is self-limiting but with poor oral hygiene it
can be a focus for blood-borne infection.</p></div><div id="_100100.8"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Tumour lysis syndrome</h2> <p class="cAX">Tumour lysis syndrome occurs secondary
to spontaneous or treatment-related rapid destruction of malignant
cells. Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome include those with
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (especially if high grade and bulky disease),
Burkitt’s lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid
leukaemia (particularly if high white blood cell counts or bulky disease),
and occasionally those with solid tumours. Pre-existing hyperuricaemia,
dehydration, and renal impairment are also predisposing factors. Features
include hyperkalaemia, hyperuricaemia (see below), and hyperphosphataemia
with hypocalcaemia; renal damage and arrhythmias can follow. Early
identification of patients at risk, and initiation of prophylaxis
or therapy for tumour lysis syndrome, is essential.</p></div></div><div class="cAZ" id="_100100.5"><h2>Hyperuricaemia</h2> <p class="cAX">Hyperuricaemia, which
may be present in <span id="_100100.16">high-grade
lymphoma</span> and <span id="_100100.14">leukaemia</span>, can be markedly worsened by chemotherapy and is associated
with acute renal failure. <span>Allopurinol</span> (<a title=" Drugs for treatment of gout" href="5310.htm#_5310">section 10.1.4</a>) should be started 24 hours
before treating such tumours and patients should be adequately hydrated. <span id="_100100.15"></span><span id="_100100.10"></span>The dose of <span>mercaptopurine</span> or <span>azathioprine</span> should be reduced if <span>allopurinol</span> needs to be given concomitantly (see Appendix
1).</p><p><span>Rasburicase</span> (section 10.1.4), a recombinant urate oxidase, is licensed for hyperuricaemia
in patients with haematological malignancy, for details, see <a title="target-block: rasburicase" href="106159.htm#_1.5">Hyperuricaemia Associated With Cytotoxic Drugs</a>. It rapidly reduces plasma-uric acid concentration and may be of
particular value in preventing complications following treatment of
leukaemias or bulky lymphomas.</p></div><div id="_100100.1"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Nausea and vomiting</h2> <p class="cAX">Nausea and vomiting cause considerable distress
to many patients who receive chemotherapy and to a lesser extent abdominal
radiotherapy, and may lead to refusal of further treatment; prophylaxis
of nausea and vomiting is therefore extremely important. Symptoms
may be acute (occurring within 24 hours of treatment), delayed (first
occurring more than 24 hours after treatment), or anticipatory (occurring
prior to subsequent doses). Delayed and anticipatory symptoms are
more difficult to control than acute symptoms and require different
management.</p><p>Patients vary in their susceptibility to drug-induced nausea
and vomiting; those affected more often include women, patients under
50 years of age, anxious patients, and those who experience motion
sickness. Susceptibility also increases with repeated exposure to
the cytotoxic drug.</p><p>Drugs may be divided according to their emetogenic potential
and some examples are given below, but the symptoms vary according
to the dose, to other drugs administered and to individual susceptibility.</p><p><i>Mildly emetogenic treatment</i>—<span>fluorouracil</span>, <span>etoposide</span>, <span>methotrexate</span> (less
than 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), the vinca alkaloids, and abdominal radiotherapy. </p><p><i>Moderately emetogenic treatment</i>—the taxanes,
doxorubicin, intermediate and low doses of <span>cyclophosphamide</span>, mitoxantrone, and high doses of <span>methotrexate</span> (0.1–1.2 g/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p><i>Highly emetogenic treatment</i>—<span>cisplatin</span>, <span>dacarbazine</span>, and high doses of <span>cyclophosphamide</span>.</p><div><h3 class="cAE">Prevention of acute symptoms</h3> <p class="cAE">For patients at <i>low risk of emesis</i>, pretreatment
with domperidone or with metoclopramide, continued
for up to 24 hours after chemotherapy, is often effective (<a title=" Drugs used in nausea and vertigo" href="3398.htm#_3398">section 4.6</a>). If metoclopramide or domperidone
are not sufficiently effective, additional drugs such as dexamethasone
(6–10 mg by mouth) or lorazepam (1–2 mg by mouth) may be used.</p><p>For patients at <i>high risk of emesis</i>, a 5HT<sub>3</sub>-receptor antagonist (<a title="monograph-family: 5HT_3 antagonists" href="3440.htm#_3440">section 4.6</a>), usually given by mouth in combination
with dexamethasone and the neurokinin receptor antagonist aprepitant
is effective.</p></div><div><h3 class="cAE">Prevention of delayed symptoms</h3> <p class="cAE">For delayed symptoms associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy,
a combination of dexamethasone and 5HT<sub>3</sub>-receptor antagonist
is effective; for highly emetogenic chemotherapy, a combination of
dexamethasone and aprepitant is effective.</p></div><div style="margin-top: 1em"><h3 class="cAE">Prevention of anticipatory symptoms</h3> <p class="cAE">Good symptom control is the best way to prevent anticipatory
symptoms. Lorazepam can be helpful for its amnesic, sedative, and
anxiolytic effects.</p></div></div></div><div class="cAZ" id="_100100.6"><h2>Bone-marrow suppression</h2> <p class="cAX">All
cytotoxic drugs except vincristine and <span>bleomycin</span> cause bone-marrow suppression. This commonly
occurs 7 to 10 days after administration, but is delayed for certain
drugs, such as <span>carmustine</span>, <span>lomustine</span>, and <span>melphalan</span>. Peripheral blood counts must
be checked before each treatment, and doses should be reduced or therapy
delayed if bone-marrow has not recovered.</p><p>Cytotoxic drugs may be contra-indicated in patients with acute infection; any infection should be
treated before, or when starting, cytotoxic drugs.</p><p>Fever in a neutropenic patient (neutrophil count less than 1.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/litre) requires immediate broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy.
Appropriate bacteriological investigations should be conducted as
soon as possible. Patients taking cytotoxic drugs who
have signs or symptoms of infection should be advised to seek prompt
medical attention. All patients should initially be
investigated and treated under the supervision of the appropriate
oncology or haematology specialist.</p><p>In selected patients, the duration and the severity of neutropenia
can be reduced by the use of amifostine or recombinant human granulocyte-colony
stimulating factors, <a title=" Drugs used in neutropenia" href="4926.htm#_4926">section 9.1.6</a>.</p><p>Symptomatic anaemia is usually treated with red blood cell transfusions.
For guidance on the use of erythropoietins in patients with cancer,
see <a title="target-block: Erythropoietins MHRA/CHM advice (target haemoglobin concentration)" href="4915.htm#_200198">MHRA/CHM advice</a> and <a title="target-block: Erythropoietins NICE guidance cancer-related anaemia" href="4915.htm#_200806">NICE guidance</a>.</p></div><p>For advice on the use of live vaccines in individuals with impaired
immune response, see <a title="BNF:target-block: contra-indications" href="6451.htm#_6451.4">section 14.1</a>.</p><div class="cAZ"><h2>Alopecia</h2> <p class="cAX"> Reversible
hair loss is a common complication, although it varies in degree between
drugs and individual patients. No pharmacological methods of preventing
this are available.</p></div><div id="_100100.2"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Pregnancy and reproductive function</h2> <p class="cAX">Most cytotoxic drugs
are teratogenic and <span id="_100100.11">should not be administered during pregnancy, especially during the
first trimester. Exclude pregnancy before treatment with
cytotoxic drugs. Considerable caution is necessary if
a pregnant woman presents with cancer requiring chemotherapy, and
specialist advice should always be sought.</span></p><p><span id="_100100.12">Contraceptive advice should be given to men and women</span> before cytotoxic therapy begins (and should cover
the duration of contraception required after therapy has ended).</p><p>Regimens that do not contain an alkylating drug or procarbazine
may have less effect on fertility, but those with an alkylating drug
or procarbazine carry the <span id="_100100.13">risk of causing permanent male sterility</span> (there is no effect on potency). Pretreatment counselling and consideration
of sperm storage may be appropriate. Women are less severely affected,
though the span of reproductive life may be shortened by the onset
of a premature menopause. No increase in fetal abnormalities or abortion
rate has been recorded in patients who remain fertile after cytotoxic
chemotherapy.</p></div></div><div class="cAZ" id="_100100.7"><h2>Thromboembolism</h2> <p class="cAX">Venous thromboembolism
can be a complication of cancer itself, but chemotherapy increases
the risk.</p></div></div><?highlighter on?><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="4676.htm">Previous: 8.1 Cytotoxic drugs</a> | <a class="top" href="100100.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="204209.htm">Next: Treatment for cytotoxic-induced side-effects</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="35091.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain 2012.
