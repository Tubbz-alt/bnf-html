Advantages of combined oral contraceptives include:</p><ul><li><p>reliable and reversible;</p> </li><li><p>reduced dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia;</p> </li><li><p>reduced incidence of premenstrual tension;</p> </li><li><p>less symptomatic fibroids and functional ovarian cysts;</p> </li><li><p>less benign breast disease;</p> </li><li><p>reduced risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer;</p> </li><li><p>reduced risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.</p> </li></ul><p>Combined oral contraceptives containing a fixed amount of an oestrogen and a progestogen in each active tablet are termed ‘monophasic’; those with varying amounts of the two hormones are termed ‘phasic’. A transdermal patch and a vaginal ring, both containing an oestrogen with a progestogen, are also available.</p><div><h2>Choice</h2><p>The majority of combined oral contraceptives contain ethinylestradiol as the oestrogen component; mestranol and estradiol valerate are also used. The ethinylestradiol content of combined oral contraceptives ranges from 20 to 40 micrograms. Generally a preparation with the lowest oestrogen and progestogen content which gives good cycle control and minimal side-effects in the individual woman is chosen.</p><ul><li><p><em>Low strength preparations</em> (containing ethinylestradiol 20 micrograms) are particularly appropriate for women with risk factors for circulatory disease, provided a combined oral contraceptive is otherwise suitable. It is recommended that the combined oral contraceptive is not continued beyond 50 years of age since more suitable alternatives exist.</p> </li><li><p><em>Standard strength preparations</em> (containing ethinylestradiol 30 or 35 micrograms or in 30–40 microgram <em>phased</em> preparations) are appropriate for standard use—but see Risk of Venous Thromboembolism below. Phased preparations are generally reserved for women who <em>either</em> do not have withdrawal bleeding <em>or</em> who have breakthrough bleeding with monophasic products.</p> </li></ul><p>The progestogens desogestrel, drospirenone, and gestodene (in combination with ethinylestradiol) may be considered for women who have side-effects (such as acne, headache, depression, breast symptoms, and breakthrough bleeding) with other progestogens. However, women should be advised that these progestogens have also been associated with an increased risk of <em>venous thromboembolism</em>. Drospirenone, a derivative of spironolactone, has anti-androgenic and anti-mineralocorticoid activity; it should be used with care if an increased plasma-potassium concentration might be hazardous.</p><p>The progestogen norelgestromin is combined with ethinylestradiol in a transdermal patch (<em>Evra</em>®).</p><p>The vaginal contraceptive ring contains the progestogen etonogestrel combined with ethinylestradiol (<em>NuvaRing</em>®).</p></div><div id="PHP4870"><h2>Risk of venous thromboembolism</h2><p>There is an increased risk of venous thromboembolic disease (particularly during the first year) in users of oral contraceptives, but this risk is considerably smaller than that associated with pregnancy (about 60 cases of venous thromboembolic disease per 100 000 pregnancies). In all cases the risk of venous thromboembolism increases with age and in the presence of other risk factors for venous thromboembolism, such as obesity.</p><p>The incidence of venous thromboembolism in healthy, non-pregnant women who are not taking an oral contraceptive is about 5–10 cases per 100 000 women per year. For those using combined oral contraceptives containing second-generation progestogens, such as levonorgestrel, this incidence is about 20 per 100 000 women per year of use. The risk of venous thromboembolism with transdermal patches may be slightly increased compared with combined oral contraceptives that contain levonorgestrel. Some studies have reported a greater risk of venous thromboembolism in women using combined oral contraceptives containing the third-generation progestogens desogestrel and gestodene; the incidence in these women is about 40 per 100 000 women per year of use. The absolute risk of venous thromboembolism in women using combined oral contraceptives containing these third-generation progestogens is very small and well below the risk associated with pregnancy. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using a combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone may be similar to that associated with combined oral contraceptives containing third-generation progestogens. The risk of venous thromboembolism associated with vaginal ring use compared to the risk with other combined hormonal contraceptives is unknown.</p><p>Provided that women are informed of the relative risks of venous thromboembolism and accept them, the choice of oral contraceptive is for the woman together with the prescriber jointly to make in light of her individual medical history and any contra-indications.</p></div><div id="PHP4871"><h2>Travel</h2><p>Women taking oral contraceptives or using the patch or vaginal ring are at an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis during travel involving long periods of immobility (over 5 hours). The risk may be reduced by appropriate exercise during the journey and possibly by wearing graduated compression hosiery.</p></div><div id="PHP4872"><h2>Missed pill</h2><p>The critical time for loss of contraceptive protection is when a pill is omitted at the <em>beginning</em> or <em>end</em> of a cycle (which lengthens the pill-free interval).</p><p>If a woman forgets to take a pill, it should be taken as soon as she remembers, and the next one taken at the normal time (even if this means taking 2 pills together). A missed pill is one that is 24 or more hours late; for women taking <em>Qlaira</em>®, see below. If a woman misses only one pill, she should take an active pill as soon as she remembers and then resume normal pill-taking. No additional precautions are necessary.</p><p>If a woman misses 2 or more pills (especially from the first 7 in a packet), she may not be protected. She should take an active pill as soon as she remembers and then resume normal pill-taking. In addition, she must either abstain from sex or use an additional method of contraception such as a condom for the next 7 days. If these 7 days run beyond the end of the packet, the next packet should be started at once, omitting the pill-free interval (or, in the case of <em>everyday</em> (ED) pills, omitting the 7 inactive tablets).</p><p>A missed pill for a woman taking <em>Qlaira</em>® is one that is 12 hours or more late; for information on how to manage missed pills in women taking <em>Qlaira</em>®, refer to product literature.</p><p>Emergency contraception (<a title="sub-section: Emergency contraception" href="PHP5018-emergency-contraception.htm">section 7.3.5</a>) is recommended if 2 or more combined oral contraceptive tablets are missed from the first 7 tablets in a packet and unprotected intercourse has occurred since finishing the last packet.</p></div><div><h2>Delayed application or detached patch</h2><p>If a patch is partly detached for less than 24 hours, reapply to the same site or replace with a new patch immediately; no additional contraception is needed and the next patch should be applied on the usual ‘change day’. If a patch remains detached for more than 24 hours or if the user is not aware when the patch became detached, then stop the current contraceptive cycle and start a new cycle by applying a new patch, giving a new ‘Day 1’; an additional non-hormonal contraceptive must be used concurrently for the first 7 days of the new cycle.</p><p>If application of a new patch at the start of a new cycle is delayed, contraceptive protection is lost. A new patch should be applied as soon as remembered giving a new ‘Day 1’; additional non-hormonal methods of contraception should be used for the first 7 days of the new cycle. If intercourse has occurred during this extended patch-free interval, a possibility of fertilisation should be considered. If application of a patch in the middle of the cycle is delayed (i.e. the patch is not changed on day 8 or day 15):</p><ul><li><p>for up to 48 hours, apply a new patch immediately; next patch ‘change day’ remains the same and no additional contraception is required;</p> </li><li><p>for more than 48 hours, contraceptive protection may have been lost. Stop the current cycle and start a new 4-week cycle immediately by applying a new patch giving a new ‘Day 1’; additional non-hormonal contraception should be used for the first 7 days of the new cycle.</p> </li></ul><p>If the patch is not removed at the end of the cycle (day 22), remove it as soon as possible and start the next cycle on the usual ‘change day’, the day after day 28; no additional contraception is required.</p></div><div id="PHP4873"><h2>Expulsion, delayed insertion or removal, or broken vaginal ring</h2><p>If the vaginal ring is expelled for <em>less than 3 hours</em>, rinse the ring with cool water and reinsert immediately; no additional contraception is needed.</p><p>If the ring remains outside the vagina for <em>more than 3 hours</em> or if the user does not know when the ring was expelled, contraceptive protection may be reduced:</p><ul><li><p>If ring expelled during week 1 or 2 of cycle, rinse ring with cool water and reinsert; use additional precautions (barrier methods) for next 7 days;</p> </li><li><p>If ring expelled during week 3 of cycle, either insert a new ring to start a new cycle <em>or</em> allow a withdrawal bleed and insert a new ring no later than 7 days after ring was expelled; latter option only available if ring was used continuously for at least 7 days before expulsion.</p> </li></ul><p>If insertion of a new ring at the start of a new cycle is delayed, contraceptive protection is lost. A new ring should be inserted as soon as possible; additional precautions (barrier methods) should be used for the first 7 days of the new cycle. If intercourse occurred during the extended ring-free interval, pregnancy should be considered.</p><p>No additional contraception is required if removal of the ring is delayed by up to 1 week (4 weeks of continuous use). The 7-day ring-free interval should be observed and subsequently a new ring should be inserted. Contraceptive protection may be reduced with continuous use of the ring for more than 4 weeks—pregnancy should be ruled out before inserting a new ring.</p><p>If the ring breaks during use, remove it and insert a new ring immediately; additional precautions (barrier methods) should be used for the first 7 days of the new cycle.</p></div><div id="PHP4874"><h2>Diarrhoea and vomiting</h2><p>Vomiting and persistent, severe diarrhoea can interfere with the absorption of combined oral contraceptives. If vomiting occurs within 2 hours of taking a combined oral contraceptive another pill should be taken as soon as possible. In cases of persistent vomiting or severe diarrhoea lasting more than 24 hours, additional precautions should be used during and for 7 days (9 days for <em>Qlaira</em>®) after recovery (see also under <a title="target-block: Missed pill" href="PHP4869-combined-hormonal-contraceptives.htm#PHP4872">Missed pill</a>). If the vomiting and diarrhoea occurs during the last 7 tablets, the next pill-free interval should be omitted (in the case of ED tablets the inactive ones should be omitted).</p></div><div id="PHP4875"><h2>Interactions</h2><p>The effectiveness of <em>combined</em> oral contraceptives, <em>progestogen-only</em> oral contraceptives (<a title="BNF:sub-sub-section: Oral progestogen-only contraceptives" href="PHP4944-oral-progestogen-only-contraceptives.htm">section 7.3.2.1</a>), contraceptive patches, and vaginal rings can be considerably reduced by interaction with drugs that induce hepatic enzyme activity (e.g. <strong>carbamazepine</strong>, <strong>eslicarbazepine</strong>, <strong>nelfinavir</strong>, <strong>nevirapine</strong>, <strong>oxcarbazepine</strong>, <strong>phenytoin</strong>, <strong>phenobarbital</strong>, <strong>primidone</strong>, <strong>ritonavir</strong>, <strong>St John's Wort</strong>, <strong>topiramate</strong>, and, above all, <strong>rifabutin</strong> and <strong>rifampicin</strong>). A condom together with a long-acting method, such as an injectable contraceptive, may be more suitable for patients with HIV infection or at risk of HIV infection; advice on the possibility of interaction with antiretroviral drugs should be sought from HIV specialists.</p><p>Women taking combined hormonal contraceptives who require enzyme-inducing drugs should be advised to change to a contraceptive method that is unaffected by enzyme-inducers (e.g. some parenteral progestogen-only contraceptives (<a title="BNF:target-block: Parenteral progesterone only contraceptives interactions" href="PHP4960-parenteral-progestogen-only-contraceptives.htm#PHP4965">section 7.3.2.2</a>), intra-uterine devices) for the duration of treatment and for 4 weeks after stopping. If a change in contraceptive method is undesirable or inappropriate the following options should be discussed:</p><ul><li><p>For a <em>short course (2 months or less) of an enzyme-inducing drug</em> (except rifampicin or rifabutin—see below), continue with a combined oral contraceptive providing ethinylestradiol 30 micrograms or more daily and use a ‘tricycling’ regimen (i.e. taking 3 packets of monophasic tablets without a break followed by a shortened tablet-free interval of 4 days [unlicensed use]). Additional contraceptive precautions should also be used whilst taking the enzyme-inducing drug and for 4 weeks after stopping. Another option is to follow the advice for long-term courses, below.</p>  <p>For women using combined hormonal contraceptive patches or vaginal rings, additional contraceptive precautions are also required whilst taking the enzyme-inducing drug and for 4 weeks after stopping. If concomitant administration runs beyond the 3 weeks of patch or vaginal ring use, a new treatment cycle should be started immediately, without a patch-free or ring-free break.</p> </li><li><p>For a <em>long-term course (over 2 months) of an enzyme-inducing drug</em> (except rifampicin or rifabutin—see below), adjust the dose of combined oral contraceptive to provide ethinylestradiol 50 micrograms or more daily [unlicensed use] and use a ‘tricycling' regimen (as above); continue for the duration of treatment with the enzyme-inducing drug and for 4 weeks after stopping. </p>  <p>If breakthrough bleeding occurs (and all other causes are ruled out) it is recommended that the dose of ethinylestradiol is increased by increments of 10 micrograms up to a maximum of 70 micrograms daily [unlicensed use], or to use additional precautions, or to change to a method unaffected by enzyme-inducing drugs.</p>  <p>Contraceptive patches and vaginal rings are not recommended for women taking enzyme-inducing drugs over a long period.</p> </li><li><p>For any course of <strong>rifampicin</strong> or <strong>rifabutin</strong>, an alternative method of contraception (such as an IUD) is <strong>always</strong> recommended because they are such potent enzyme-inducing drugs; the alternative method of contraception should be continued for 4 weeks after stopping the enzyme-inducing drug.</p> </li></ul><p>For information on interactions of oral progestogen-only contraceptives, see also <a title="BNF:target-block: POP cautions" href="PHP4944-oral-progestogen-only-contraceptives.htm#PHP4945">section 7.3.2.1</a>; for information on interactions of parenteral progestogen-only contraceptives, see also <a title="BNF:target-block: Parenteral progesterone only contraceptives interactions" href="PHP4960-parenteral-progestogen-only-contraceptives.htm#PHP4965">section 7.3.2.2</a>; for information on interactions of the intra-uterine progestogen-only device, see also <a title="BNF:target-block: Cautions and contra-indications" href="PHP4973-intra-uterine-progestogen-only-device.htm#PHP4974">section 7.3.2.3</a>; for information on interactions of hormonal emergency contraception, see also <a title="BNF:target-block: Emergency hormonal contraception interactions" href="PHP5019-hormonal-methods.htm#PHP5024">section 7.3.5</a>.</p><div><div class="cE"><h3 class="cT">Antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes</h3> <p class="cT">Latest recommendations are that no additional contraceptive precautions are required when <em>combined</em> oral contraceptives are used with antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes, unless diarrhoea or vomiting occur (<a title="BNF:target-block: COC diarrhoea and vomiting" href="PHP4869-combined-hormonal-contraceptives.htm#PHP4874">see above</a>). These recommendations should be discussed with the woman, who should also be advised that guidance in patient information leaflets may differ. </p></div><p>It is also currently recommended that no additional contraceptive precautions are required when contraceptive patches or vaginal rings are used with antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes. There have been concerns that some antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes (e.g. ampicillin, doxycycline) reduce the efficacy of <em>combined</em> oral contraceptives by impairing the bacterial flora responsible for recycling ethinylestradiol from the large bowel. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this interaction. </p></div></div><div id="PHP4877"><h2>Surgery</h2><p>Oestrogen-containing contraceptives should preferably be discontinued (and adequate alternative contraceptive arrangements made) 4 weeks before major elective surgery and all surgery to the legs or surgery which involves prolonged immobilisation of a lower limb; they should normally be recommenced at the first menses occurring at least 2 weeks after full mobilisation. A progestogen-only contraceptive may be offered as an alternative and the oestrogen-containing contraceptive restarted after mobilisation, as above. When discontinuation of an oestrogen-containing contraceptive is not possible, e.g. after trauma or if a patient admitted for an elective procedure is still on an oestrogen-containing contraceptive, thromboprophylaxis (with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin and graduated compression hosiery) is advised. These recommendations do not apply to minor surgery with short duration of anaesthesia, e.g. laparoscopic sterilisation or tooth extraction, or to women using oestrogen-free hormonal contraceptives.</p></div><div id="PHP4878"><h2>Reason to stop immediately</h2><p>Combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be stopped (pending investigation and treatment), if any of the following occur:</p><ul><li><p>sudden severe chest pain (even if not radiating to left arm);</p> </li><li><p>sudden breathlessness (or cough with blood-stained sputum);</p> </li><li><p>unexplained swelling or severe pain in calf of one leg;</p> </li><li><p>severe stomach pain;</p> </li><li><p>serious neurological effects including unusual severe, prolonged headache especially if first time or getting progressively worse <em>or</em> sudden partial or complete loss of vision <em>or</em> sudden disturbance of hearing or other perceptual disorders <em>or</em> dysphasia <em>or</em> bad fainting attack or collapse <em>or</em> first unexplained epileptic seizure <em>or</em> weakness, motor disturbances, very marked numbness suddenly affecting one side or one part of body;</p> </li><li><p>hepatitis, jaundice, liver enlargement;</p> </li><li><p>blood pressure above systolic 160 mmHg or diastolic 95 mmHg;</p> </li><li><p>prolonged immobility after surgery or leg injury;</p> </li><li><p>detection of a risk factor which contra-indicates treatment (see Cautions and Contra-indications under Combined Hormonal Contraceptives below or under Oestrogens for HRT (<a title="monograph: OESTROGENS FOR HRT" href="PHP4420-oestrogens-for-hrt.htm">section 6.4.1.1</a>)).</p> </li></ul></div></div><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li id="_PHP4879-combined-hormonal-contraceptives"><a href="PHP4879-combined-hormonal-contraceptives.htm" title="COMBINED HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES">COMBINED HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES</a></li></ul></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="PHP4853-contraceptives.htm">Previous: 7.3 Contraceptives</a> | <a class="top" href="PHP4869-combined-hormonal-contraceptives.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="PHP4879-combined-hormonal-contraceptives.htm">Next: COMBINED HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Cookie and Privacy Policy">Cookie and Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="PHP0-publication-information.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and Pharmaceutical Press 2012.
