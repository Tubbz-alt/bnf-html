This is particularly important during pregnancy, when the risk to both mother and fetus must be considered (for further details see <a title="BNF:prelim-section: Prescribing in pregnancy" href="PHP111-prescribing-in-pregnancy.htm">Prescribing in Pregnancy</a>).</p><p>It is important to discuss treatment options carefully with the patient to ensure that the patient is content to take the medicine as prescribed (see also Taking Medicines to Best Effect, below). In particular, the patient should be helped to distinguish the adverse effects of prescribed drugs from the effects of the medical disorder. When the beneficial effects of the medicine are likely to be delayed, the patient should be advised of this. </p><div><h2>Taking medicines to best effect</h2><p>Difficulties in adherence to drug treatment occur regardless of age. Factors contributing to poor compliance with prescribed medicines include:</p><ul><li><p>prescription not collected or not dispensed;</p> </li><li><p>purpose of medicine not clear;</p> </li><li><p>perceived lack of efficacy;</p> </li><li><p>real or perceived adverse effects;</p> </li><li><p>patients' perception of the risk and severity of side-effects may differ from that of the prescriber;</p> </li><li><p>instructions for administration not clear;</p> </li><li><p>physical difficulty in taking medicines (e.g. swallowing the medicine, handling small tablets, or opening medicine containers);</p> </li><li><p>unattractive formulation (e.g. unpleasant taste);</p> </li><li><p>complicated regimen.</p> </li></ul><p>The prescriber and the patient should agree on the health outcomes that the patient desires and on the strategy for achieving them (‘concordance’). The prescriber should be sensitive to religious, cultural, and personal beliefs that can affect a patient's acceptance of medicines.</p><p>Taking the time to explain to the patient (and relatives) the rationale and the potential adverse effects of treatment may improve adherence. Reinforcement and elaboration of the physician's instructions by the pharmacist and other members of the healthcare team also helps. Advising the patient of the possibility of alternative treatments may encourage the patient to seek advice rather than merely abandon unacceptable treatment.</p><p>Simplifying the drug regimen may help; the need for frequent administration may reduce adherence, although there appears to be little difference in adherence between once-daily and twice-daily administration. Combination products reduce the number of drugs taken but at the expense of the ability to titrate individual doses.</p></div><div id="PHP61"><h2>Biosimilar medicines</h2><p>A biosimilar medicine is a new biological product that is similar to a medicine that has already been authorised to be marketed (the biological reference medicine) in the European Union. The active substance of a biosimilar medicine is similar, but not identical, to the biological reference medicine. Biological products are different from standard chemical products in terms of their complexity and although theoretically there should be no important differences between the biosimilar and the biological reference medicine in terms of safety or efficacy, when prescribing biological products, it is good practice to use the brand name. This will ensure that substitution of a biosimilar medicine does not occur when the medicine is dispensed.</p><p>Biosimilar medicines have black triangle status (<a title="Report adverse reaction(s)" href="PHP10518-yellow-card-scheme.htm"><img class="cD" src="images/blacktri_s.png" alt="Report adverse reaction(s)" /></a>) at the time of initial marketing; however, in light of new EU legislation this will change, for latest information see <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>. It is important to report suspected adverse reactions to biosimilar medicines using the Yellow Card Scheme (see <a title="prelim-section: Adverse reactions to drugs" href="PHP88-adverse-reactions-to-drugs.htm">Adverse Reactions to Drugs</a>). For biosimilar medicines, adverse reaction reports should clearly state the brand name and the batch number of the suspected medicine.</p></div><div><h2>Complementary and alternative medicine</h2><p>An increasing amount of information on complementary  and alternative medicine is becoming available. The scope of the BNF is restricted to the discussion of conventional medicines but reference is made to complementary treatments if they affect conventional therapy (e.g. interactions with St John's wort—see Appendix 1). Further information on herbal medicines is available at <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Abbreviation of titles</h2><p>In general, titles of drugs and preparations should be written <em>in full</em>. Unofficial abbreviations should not be used as they may be misinterpreted.</p></div><div><h2>Non-proprietary titles</h2><p>Where non-proprietary (‘generic’) titles are given, they should be used in prescribing. This will enable any suitable product to be dispensed, thereby saving delay to the patient and sometimes expense to the health service. The only exception is where there is a demonstrable difference in clinical effect between each manufacturer's version of the formulation, making it important that the patient should always receive the same brand; in such cases, the brand name or the manufacturer should be stated. Non-proprietary titles should <strong>not</strong> be invented for the purposes of prescribing generically since this can lead to confusion, particularly in the case of compound and modified-release preparations.</p><p>Titles used as headings for monographs may be used freely in the United Kingdom but in other countries may be subject to restriction.</p><p>Many of the non-proprietary titles used in this book are titles of monographs in the European Pharmacopoeia, British Pharmacopoeia, or British Pharmaceutical Codex 1973. In such cases the preparations must comply with the standard (if any) in the appropriate publication, as required by the Medicines Act (Section 65).</p></div><div><h2>Proprietary titles</h2><p>Names followed by the symbol® are or have been used as proprietary names in the United Kingdom. These names may in general be applied only to products supplied by the owners of the trade marks.</p></div><div id="PHP62"><h2>Marketing authorisation and BNF advice</h2><p>In general the <em>doses, indications, cautions, contra-indications,</em> and <em>side-effects</em> in the BNF reflect those in the manufacturers' data sheets or Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs) which, in turn, reflect those in the corresponding marketing authorisations (formerly known as Product Licences). The BNF does not generally include proprietary medicines that are not supported by a valid Summary of Product Characteristics or when the marketing authorisation holder has not been able to supply essential information. When a preparation is available from more than one manufacturer, the BNF reflects advice that is the most clinically relevant regardless of any variation in the marketing authorisations. Unlicensed products can be obtained from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies, see <a title="BNF:appendix: Special-order Manufacturers" href="PHP10403-special-order-manufacturers.htm">Special-Order Manufacturers</a>.</p><p>Where an unlicensed drug is included in the BNF, this is indicated in square brackets after the entry. When the BNF suggests a use (or route) that is outside the licensed indication of a product (‘off-label’ use), this too is indicated. Unlicensed use of medicines becomes necessary if the clinical need cannot be met by licensed medicines; such use should be supported by appropriate evidence and experience. </p><p>The doses stated in the BNF are intended for general guidance and represent, unless otherwise stated, the usual range of doses that are generally regarded as being suitable for adults.</p><div class="cI"><h3 class="cT">Prescribing unlicensed medicines</h3><p>Prescribing medicines outside the recommendations of their marketing authorisation alters (and probably increases) the prescriber's professional responsibility and potential liability. The prescriber should be able to justify and feel competent in using such medicines.</p></div></div><div id="PHP63"><h2>Oral syringes</h2><p>An <strong>oral syringe</strong> is supplied when oral liquid medicines are prescribed in doses other than multiples of 5 mL. The oral syringe is marked in 0.5-mL divisions from 1 to 5 mL to measure doses of less than 5 mL (other sizes of oral syringe may also be available). It is provided with an adaptor and an instruction leaflet. The <em>5-mL spoon</em> is used for doses of 5 mL (or multiples thereof).</p><div class="cI"><h3 class="cT">Important</h3><p>To avoid inadvertent intravenous administration of oral liquid medicines, only an appropriate <strong>oral</strong> or <strong>enteral syringe</strong> should be used to measure an oral liquid medicine (if a medicine spoon or graduated measure cannot be used); these syringes should <strong>not</strong> be compatible with intravenous or other parenteral devices. Oral or enteral syringes should be clearly labelled ‘Oral’ or ‘Enteral’ in a large font size; it is the healthcare practitioner's responsibility to label the syringe with this information if the manufacturer has not done so.</p></div></div><div id="PHP64"><h2>Excipients</h2><p>Branded oral liquid preparations that do not contain <em> fructose</em>, <em>glucose</em>, or <em>sucrose</em> are described as ‘sugar-free’ in the BNF. Preparations containing hydrogenated glucose syrup, mannitol, maltitol, sorbitol, or xylitol are also marked ‘sugar-free’ since there is evidence that they do not cause dental caries. Patients receiving medicines containing cariogenic sugars should be advised of appropriate dental hygiene measures to prevent caries. Sugar-free preparations should be used whenever possible.</p><p>Where information on the presence of <em>aspartame</em><em>, gluten</em>, <em>sulfites</em>, <em>tartrazine</em>, <em>arachis (peanut) oil</em> or <em>sesame oil</em> is available, this is indicated in the BNF against the relevant preparation.</p><p>Information is provided on <em>selected excipients</em> in skin preparations (<a title=" Excipients and sensitisation" href="PHP7456-excipients-and-sensitisation.htm">section 13.1.3</a>), in vaccines (<a title="section: Active immunity" href="PHP8210-active-immunity.htm">section 14.1</a>), and on <em>selected preservatives</em> and <em>excipients</em> in eye drops and injections.</p><p>The presence of <em>benzyl alcohol</em> and <em>polyoxyl castor oil</em> (polyethoxylated castor oil) in injections is indicated in the BNF. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal toxic syndrome in preterm neonates, and therefore, parenteral preparations containing the preservative should not be used in neonates. Polyoxyl castor oils, used as vehicles in intravenous injections, have been associated with severe anaphylactoid reactions.</p><p>The presence of <em>propylene glycol</em> in oral or parenteral medicines is indicated in the BNF; it can cause adverse effects if its elimination is impaired, e.g. in renal failure, in neonates and young children, and in slow metabolisers of the substance. It may interact with disulfiram and metronidazole.</p><p>The <em>lactose</em> content in most medicines is too small to cause problems in most lactose-intolerant patients. However in severe lactose intolerance, the lactose content should be determined before prescribing. The amount of lactose varies according to manufacturer, product, formulation, and strength.</p><div class="cI"><h3 class="cT">Important</h3><p>In the absence of information on excipients in the BNF and in the product literature (available at <a href="http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc">www.medicines.org.uk/emc</a>), contact the manufacturer (see <a title=" Index of manufacturers" href="PHP10005-index-of-manufacturers.htm">Index of Manufacturers</a>) if it is essential to check details.</p></div></div><div><h2>Extemporaneous preparation</h2><p>A product should be dispensed extemporaneously only when no product with a marketing authorisation is available.</p><p>The BP direction that a preparation must be<em> freshly prepared</em> indicates that it must be made not more than 24 hours before it is issued for use. The direction that a preparation should be <em>recently prepared</em> indicates that deterioration is likely if the preparation is stored for longer than about 4 weeks at 15–25° C.</p><p>The term <strong>water</strong> used without qualification means either potable water freshly drawn direct from the public supply and suitable for drinking or freshly boiled and cooled purified water. The latter should be used if the public supply is from a local storage tank or if the potable water is unsuitable for a particular preparation (Water for injections, <a title=" Parenteral preparations for fluid and electrolyte imbalance" href="PHP5994-parenteral-preparations-for-fluid-and-electrolyte-imbalance.htm">section 9.2.2</a>).</p></div><div id="PHP65"><h2>Drugs and driving</h2><p>Prescribers and other healthcare professionals should advise patients if treatment is likely to affect their ability to perform skilled tasks (e.g. driving). This applies especially to drugs with sedative effects; patients should be warned that these effects are increased by alcohol. General information about a patient's fitness to drive is available from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency at <a href="http://www.dvla.gov.uk">www.dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Patents</h2><p>In the BNF, certain drugs have been included notwithstanding the existence of actual or potential patent rights. In so far as such substances are protected by Letters Patent, their inclusion in this Formulary neither conveys, nor implies, licence to manufacture.</p></div><div><h2>Health and safety</h2><p>When handling chemical or biological materials particular attention should be given to the possibility of allergy, fire, explosion, radiation, or poisoning. Substances such as corticosteroids, some antimicrobials, phenothiazines, and many cytotoxics, are irritant or very potent and should be handled with caution. Contact with the skin and inhalation of dust should be avoided.</p></div><div id="PHP66"><h2>Safety in the home</h2><p>Patients must be warned to keep all medicines out of the reach of children. All solid dose and all oral and external liquid preparations must be dispensed in a reclosable <em>child-resistant container</em> unless:</p><ul><li><p>the medicine is in an original pack or patient pack such as to make this inadvisable;</p> </li><li><p>the patient will have difficulty in opening a child-resistant container;</p> </li><li><p>a specific request is made that the product shall not be dispensed in a child-resistant container;</p> </li><li><p>no suitable child-resistant container exists for a particular liquid preparation.</p> </li></ul><p>All patients should be advised to dispose of <em>unwanted medicines</em> by returning them to a supplier for destruction.</p></div><div id="PHP67"><h2>Labelling of prescribed medicines</h2><p>There is a legal requirement for the following to appear on the label of any prescribed medicine:</p><ul><li>name of the patient;</li><li><p>name and address of the person dispensing the medicine;</p></li><li>date of dispensing;</li><li><p>name of the medicine;</p></li><li><p>directions for use of the medicine;</p></li><li><p>precautions relating to the use of the medicine;</p></li><li><p>the words 'Keep out of the reach of children' (or a similar warning);</p></li><li><p>where applicable, the words 'For external use only'.</p></li></ul>A pharmacist can exercise professional skill and judgement to amend or include more appropriate wording for the name of the medicine, the directions for use, or the precautions relating to the use of the medicine.<p>The Royal Pharmaceutical Society advises that the labels of dispensed medicines should indicate the total quantity of the product dispensed in the container to which the label refers. This requirement applies equally to solid, liquid, internal, and external preparations. If a product is dispensed in more than one container, the reference should be to the amount in each container.</p> <div class="cI" id="PHP68"><h3 class="cT">Non-proprietary names of compound preparations</h3><p>Non-proprietary names of <strong>compound preparations</strong> which appear in the BNF are those that have been compiled by the British Pharmacopoeia Commission or another recognised body; whenever possible they reflect the names of the active ingredients.</p><p>Prescribers should avoid creating their own compound names for the purposes of generic prescribing; such names do not have an approved definition and can be misinterpreted.</p><p>Special care should be taken to avoid errors when prescribing compound preparations; in particular the hyphen in the prefix ‘co-’ should be retained.</p><p>Special care should also be taken to avoid creating generic names for <strong>modified-release</strong> preparations where the use of these names could lead to confusion between formulations with different lengths of action.</p></div> </div><div><h2>EEA and Swiss prescriptions</h2><p>Pharmacists can dispense prescriptions issued by doctors and dentists from the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland (except prescriptions for controlled drugs in Schedules 1, 2, or 3, or for drugs without a UK marketing authorisation). Prescriptions should be written in ink or otherwise so as to be indelible, should be dated, should state the name of the patient, should state the address of the prescriber, should contain particulars indicating whether the prescriber is a doctor or dentist, and should be signed by the prescriber.</p></div><div><h2>Security and validity of prescriptions</h2><p>The Councils of the British Medical Association and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society have issued a joint statement on the security and validity of prescriptions.</p><p>In particular, prescription forms should:</p><ul><li><p>not be left unattended at reception desks;</p> </li><li><p>not be left in a car where they may be visible; and</p> </li><li><p>when not in use, be kept in a locked drawer within the surgery and at home.</p> </li></ul><p>Where there is any doubt about the authenticity of a prescription, the pharmacist should contact the prescriber. If this is done by telephone, the number should be obtained from the directory rather than relying on the information on the prescription form, which may be false.</p></div><div id="PHP69"><h2>Patient group direction (PGD)</h2><p>In most cases, the most appropriate clinical care will be provided on an individual basis by a prescriber to a specific individual patient. However, a Patient Group Direction for supply and administration of medicines by other healthcare professionals can be used where it would benefit patient care without compromising safety.</p><p>A Patient Group Direction is a written direction relating to the supply and administration (or administration only) of a licensed prescription-only medicine (including some Controlled Drugs in specific circumstances) by certain classes of healthcare professionals; the Direction is signed by a doctor (or dentist) and by a pharmacist. Further information on Patient Group Directions is available in Health Service Circular HSC 2000/026 (England), HDL (2001) 7 (Scotland), and WHC (2000) 116 (Wales) and at <a href="http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/Communities/NELM/PGDs">www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/Communities/NeLM/PGDs</a>; see also the Human Medicines Regulations 2012.</p></div><div id="PHP70"><h2>NICE and Scottish Medicines Consortium</h2><p id="PHP18530">Advice issued by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is included in the BNF when relevant. The BNF also includes advice issued by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) when a medicine is restricted or not recommended for use within NHS Scotland. If advice within a NICE Single Technology Appraisal differs from SMC advice, the Scottish Executive expects NHS Boards within NHS Scotland to comply with the SMC advice.
