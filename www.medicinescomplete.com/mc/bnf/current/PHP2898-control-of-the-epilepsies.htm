Careful adjustment of doses is necessary, starting with low doses and increasing gradually until seizures are controlled or there are significant adverse effects.</p><p>When choosing an antiepileptic drug, the seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, concomitant medication, co-morbidity, age, and sex should be taken into account. For women of child-bearing age, see <a title="target-block: Pregnancy and breast-feeding in epilepsy" href="PHP2898-control-of-the-epilepsies.htm#PHP2903">Pregnancy</a> and <a title="BNF:target-block: breast-feeding control of epilepsy" href="PHP2898-control-of-the-epilepsies.htm#PHP2904">Breast-feeding</a>.</p><p>The dosage frequency is often determined by the plasma-drug half-life, and should be kept as low as possible to encourage adherence with the prescribed regimen. Most antiepileptics, when used in the usual dosage, can be given twice daily. Lamotrigine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin, which have long half-lives, can be given once daily at bedtime. However, with large doses, some antiepileptics may need to be given more frequently to avoid adverse effects associated with high peak plasma-drug concentration. Young children metabolise some antiepileptics more rapidly than adults and therefore may require more frequent doses and a higher dose in proportion to their body-weight.</p><div><h2>Management</h2><p>When monotherapy with a first-line antiepileptic drug has failed, monotherapy with a second drug should be tried; the diagnosis should be checked before starting an alternative drug if the first drug showed lack of efficacy. The change from one antiepileptic drug to another should be cautious, slowly withdrawing the first drug only when the new regimen has been established. Combination therapy with two or more antiepileptic drugs may be necessary, but the concurrent use of antiepileptic drugs increases the risk of adverse effects and drug interactions (see below). If combination therapy does not bring about worthwhile benefits, revert to the regimen (monotherapy or combination therapy) that provided the best balance between tolerability and efficacy.</p></div><div id="PHP2899"><h2>Interactions</h2><p>Interactions between antiepileptics are complex and may increase toxicity without a corresponding increase in antiepileptic effect. Interactions are usually caused by hepatic enzyme induction or inhibition; displacement from protein binding sites is not usually a problem. These interactions are highly variable and unpredictable.</p><p>For interactions of antiepileptic drugs, see <strong>Appendix 1</strong>; for advice on hormonal contraception and enzyme-inducing drugs, see <a title="BNF:target-block: COCs interactions" href="PHP4869-combined-hormonal-contraceptives.htm#PHP4875">section 7.3.1</a> and <a title="BNF:sub-section: Progestogen-only contraceptives" href="PHP4943-progestogen-only-contraceptives.htm">section 7.3.2</a>.</p><p>Significant interactions that occur <strong>between antiepileptics</strong> and that may affect dosing requirements are as follows:</p><div class="cI"><h3 class="cT">Note</h3>  <p>Check under each drug for possible interactions when two or more antiepileptic drugs are used</p> </div><p><strong>Carbamazepine</strong></p><p><em>often lowers</em> plasma concentration of clobazam, clonazepam, lamotrigine, phenytoin (but may also raise plasma-phenytoin concentration), tiagabine, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide, and an active metabolite of oxcarbazepine</p><p><em>sometimes lowers</em> plasma concentration of eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, primidone (but tendency for corresponding increase in phenobarbital level), retigabine, and rufinamide</p><p><em>sometimes raises</em> plasma concentration of phenobarbital and primidone-derived phenobarbital</p><p><strong>Eslicarbazepine</strong></p><p><em>often raises</em> plasma concentration of phenytoin</p><p><strong>Ethosuximide</strong></p><p><em>sometimes raises</em> plasma concentration of phenytoin </p><p><strong>Lamotrigine</strong></p><p><em>sometimes raises</em> plasma concentration of an active metabolite of carbamazepine (but evidence is conflicting)</p><p><strong>Oxcarbazepine </strong></p><p><em>sometimes lowers</em> plasma concentration of carbamazepine (but may raise plasma concentration of an active metabolite of carbamazepine)</p><p><em>sometimes raises</em> plasma concentration of phenytoin </p><p><em>often raises</em> plasma concentration of phenobarbital and primidone-derived phenobarbital</p><p><strong>Phenobarbital</strong> <em>or</em> <strong>primidone</strong></p><p><em>often lowers</em> plasma concentration of clonazepam, lamotrigine, phenytoin (but may also raise plasma-phenytoin concentration), tiagabine, valproate, zonisamide, and an active metabolite of oxcarbazepine</p><p><em>sometimes lowers</em> plasma concentration of ethosuximide, rufinamide, and topiramate</p><p><strong>Phenytoin </strong></p><p><em>often lowers</em> plasma concentration of clonazepam, carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, lamotrigine, tiagabine, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide, and an active metabolite of oxcarbazepine</p><p><em>often raises</em> plasma concentration of phenobarbital and primidone-derived phenobarbital</p><p><em>sometimes lowers</em> plasma concentration of ethosuximide, primidone (by increasing conversion to phenobarbital), retigabine, and rufinamide</p><p><strong>Rufinamide</strong></p><p><em>sometimes lowers</em> plasma concentration of carbamazepine</p><p><em>sometimes raises</em> plasma concentration of phenytoin</p><p><strong>Topiramate </strong></p><p><em>sometimes raises</em> plasma concentration of phenytoin</p><p><strong>Valproate</strong></p><p><em>sometimes lowers</em> plasma concentration of an active metabolite of oxcarbazepine </p><p><em>often raises</em> plasma concentration of lamotrigine, phenobarbital, primidone-derived phenobarbital, phenytoin (but may also lower), and an active metabolite of carbamazepine</p><p><em>sometimes raises</em> plasma concentration of ethosuximide and rufinamide</p><p><strong>Vigabatrin </strong></p><p><em>often lowers</em> plasma concentration of phenytoin </p></div><div id="PHP2900"><h2>Withdrawal</h2><p>Antiepileptic drugs should be withdrawn under specialist supervision. Avoid abrupt withdrawal, particularly of barbiturates and benzodiazepines, because this can precipitate severe rebound seizures. Reduction in dosage should be gradual and, in the case of barbiturates, withdrawal of the drug may take months.</p>  <p>The decision to withdraw antiepileptic drugs from a seizure-free patient, and its timing, is often difficult and depends on individual circumstances. Even in patients who have been seizure-free for several years, there is a significant risk of seizure recurrence on drug withdrawal.</p>  <p>In patients receiving several antiepileptic drugs, only one drug should be withdrawn at a time.</p> </div><div id="PHP2901"><h2>Antiepileptic hypersensitivity syndrome</h2><p>Antiepileptic hypersensitivity syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal syndrome associated with some antiepileptic drugs (<strong>carbamazepine</strong>, <strong>lacosamide</strong>, <strong>lamotrigine</strong>, <strong>oxcarbazepine</strong>, <strong>phenobarbital</strong>, <strong>phenytoin</strong>, <strong>primidone</strong>, and <strong>rufinamide</strong>); rarely cross-sensitivity occurs between some of these antiepileptic drugs. Some other antiepileptics (<strong>eslicarbazepine</strong>, <strong>stiripentol</strong>, and <strong>zonisamide</strong>) have a theoretical risk. The symptoms usually start between 1 and 8 weeks of exposure; fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy are most commonly seen. Other systemic signs include liver dysfunction, haematological, renal, and pulmonary abnormalities, vasculitis, and multi-organ failure. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity syndrome occur, the drug should be withdrawn immediately, the patient must not be re-exposed, and expert advice should be sought.</p></div><div id="PHP2902"><h2><span></span>Driving</h2><p>Patients with epilepsy may drive a motor vehicle (but not a large goods or passenger carrying vehicle) provided that they have been seizure-free for one year or, if subject to attacks only while asleep, have established a 3-year period of asleep attacks without awake attacks. Those affected by drowsiness should not drive or operate machinery.</p><p>Guidance issued by the Drivers Medical Unit of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) recommends that patients should be advised not to drive during medication changes or withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs, and for 6 months afterwards (see also <a title="target-block: DRUGS AND DRIVING" href="PHP60-general-guidance.htm#PHP65">Drugs and Driving</a> under General Guidance).</p><p>Patients who have had a first or single epileptic seizure must not drive for 6 months (5 years in the case of large goods or passenger carrying vehicles) after the event; driving may then be resumed, provided the patient has been assessed by a specialist as fit to drive because no abnormality was detected on investigation.</p></div><div id="PHP2903"><h2>Pregnancy</h2><p>Women of child-bearing potential should discuss with a specialist the impact of both epilepsy, and its treatment, on the outcome of pregnancy.</p><p>There is an increased risk of teratogenicity associated with the use of antiepileptic drugs (especially if used during the first trimester and particularly if the patient takes two or more antiepileptic drugs). Valproate is associated with the highest risk of major and minor congenital malformations, and with developmental delay. Valproate should not be prescribed unless there is no safer alternative and only after a careful discussion of the risks; doses greater than 1 g daily are associated with an increased risk of teratogenicity. There is also an increased risk of teratogenicity with phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine. Topiramate carries an increased risk of cleft palate if taken in the first trimester of pregnancy. There is not enough evidence to establish the risk of teratogenicity with other antiepileptic drugs.</p><p>Prescribers should also consider carefully the choice of antiepileptic therapy in pre-pubescent girls who may later become pregnant. </p><p>Women of child-bearing potential who take antiepileptic drugs should be given contraceptive advice. Some antiepileptic drugs can reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives, and the efficacy of some antiepileptics may be affected by hormonal contraceptives (see <a title="BNF:target-block: COCs interactions" href="PHP4869-combined-hormonal-contraceptives.htm#PHP4875">section 7.3.1</a> and interactions of antiepileptics, Appendix 1).</p><p>Women who want to become pregnant should be referred to a specialist for advice in advance of conception. For some women, the severity of seizure or the seizure type may not pose a serious threat, and drug withdrawal may be considered; therapy may be resumed after the first trimester. If treatment with antiepileptic drugs must continue throughout pregnancy, then monotherapy is preferable at the lowest effective dose.</p><p>Once an unplanned pregnancy is discovered it is usually too late for changes to be made to the treatment regimen; the risk of harm to the mother and fetus from convulsive seizures outweighs the risk of continued therapy. The likelihood of a woman who is taking antiepileptic drugs having a baby with no malformations is at least 90%, and it is important that women do not stop taking essential treatment because of concern over harm to the fetus.</p><p>To reduce the risk of neural tube defects, folate supplementation (<a title="BNF:target-block: neural tube defects" href="PHP5867-drugs-used-in-megaloblastic-anaemias.htm#PHP5869">section 9.1.2</a>) is advised before conception and throughout the first trimester.</p><p> The concentration of antiepileptic drugs in the plasma can change during pregnancy. Doses of <a title="BNF:monograph: PHENYTOIN" href="PHP2958-phenytoin.htm">phenytoin</a>, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine should be adjusted on the basis of plasma-drug concentration monitoring; the dose of other antiepileptic drugs should be monitored carefully during pregnancy and after birth, and adjustments made on a clinical basis. Plasma-drug concentration monitoring during pregnancy is also useful to check compliance. Additionally, in patients taking topiramate or levetiracetam, it is recommended that fetal growth should be monitored.</p><p> Women who have seizures in the second half of pregnancy should be assessed for eclampsia before any change is made to antiepileptic treatment. Status epilepticus should be treated according to the standard protocol, see <a title="BNF:sub-section: Drugs used in status epilepticus" href="PHP3022-drugs-used-in-status-epilepticus.htm">section 4.8.2</a>.</p><p> Routine injection of vitamin K (<a title="BNF:sub-section: Vitamin K" href="PHP6277-vitamin-k.htm">section 9.6.6</a>) at birth minimises the risk of neonatal haemorrhage associated with antiepileptics.</p><p> Withdrawal effects in the newborn may occur with some antiepileptic drugs, in particular benzodiazepines and phenobarbital.</p><div class="cI"><h3 class="cT">Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register</h3><p>All pregnant women with epilepsy, whether taking medication or not, should be encouraged to notify the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (Tel: 0800 389 1248).</p></div></div><div id="PHP2904"><h2>Breast-feeding</h2><p>Women taking antiepileptic monotherapy should generally be encouraged to breast-feed; if a woman is on combination therapy or if there are other risk factors, such as premature birth, specialist advice should be sought.</p><p>All infants should be monitored for sedation, feeding difficulties, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones. Infants should also be monitored for adverse effects associated with the antiepileptic drug particularly with newer antiepileptics, if the antiepileptic is readily transferred into breast-milk causing high infant serum-drug concentrations (e.g. ethosuximide, lamotrigine, primidone, and zonisamide), or if slower metabolism in the infant causes drugs to accumulate (e.g. phenobarbital and lamotrigine). Serum-drug concentration monitoring should be undertaken in breast-fed infants if suspected adverse reactions develop; if toxicity develops it may be necessary to introduce formula feeds to limit the infant's drug exposure, or to wean the infant off breast-milk altogether.</p><p>Primidone, phenobarbital, and the benzodiazepines are associated with an established risk of drowsiness in breast-fed babies and caution is required.</p><p>Withdrawal effects may occur in infants if a mother suddenly stops breast-feeding, particularly if she is taking phenobarbital, primidone, or lamotrigine.</p></div></div><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li><a href="PHP2905-focal-seizures-with-or-without-secondary-generalisation.htm" title="Focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation">Focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation</a></li><li><a href="PHP2906-generalised-seizures.htm" title="Generalised seizures">Generalised seizures</a></li><li><a href="PHP2907-epilepsy-syndromes.htm" title="Epilepsy syndromes">Epilepsy syndromes</a></li><li id="_PHP2908-carbamazepine-and-related-antiepileptics"><a href="PHP2908-carbamazepine-and-related-antiepileptics.htm" title="Carbamazepine and related antiepileptics">Carbamazepine and related antiepileptics</a></li><li id="_PHP2922-ethosuximide"><a href="PHP2922-ethosuximide.htm" title="Ethosuximide">Ethosuximide</a></li><li id="_PHP2929-gabapentin-and-pregabalin"><a href="PHP2929-gabapentin-and-pregabalin.htm" title="Gabapentin and pregabalin">Gabapentin and pregabalin</a></li><li id="_PHP2935-lacosamide"><a href="PHP2935-lacosamide.htm" title="Lacosamide">Lacosamide</a></li><li id="_PHP2938-lamotrigine"><a href="PHP2938-lamotrigine.htm" title="Lamotrigine">Lamotrigine</a></li><li id="_PHP2943-levetiracetam"><a href="PHP2943-levetiracetam.htm" title="Levetiracetam">Levetiracetam</a></li><li id="_PHP2947-phenobarbital-and-primidone"><a href="PHP2947-phenobarbital-and-primidone.htm" title="Phenobarbital and primidone">Phenobarbital and primidone</a></li><li id="_PHP2956-phenytoin"><a href="PHP2956-phenytoin.htm" title="Phenytoin">Phenytoin</a></li><li id="_PHP2963-retigabine"><a href="PHP2963-retigabine.htm" title="Retigabine">Retigabine</a></li><li id="_PHP2966-rufinamide"><a href="PHP2966-rufinamide.htm" title="Rufinamide">Rufinamide</a></li><li id="_PHP2970-tiagabine"><a href="PHP2970-tiagabine.htm" title="Tiagabine">Tiagabine</a></li><li id="_PHP2973-topiramate"><a href="PHP2973-topiramate.htm" title="Topiramate">Topiramate</a></li><li id="_PHP2977-valproate"><a href="PHP2977-valproate.htm" title="Valproate">Valproate</a></li><li id="_PHP2999-vigabatrin"><a href="PHP2999-vigabatrin.htm" title="Vigabatrin">Vigabatrin</a></li><li id="_PHP3002-zonisamide"><a href="PHP3002-zonisamide.htm" title="Zonisamide">Zonisamide</a></li><li id="_PHP3005-benzodiazepines"><a href="PHP3005-benzodiazepines.htm" title="Benzodiazepines">Benzodiazepines</a></li><li><a href="PHP3017-other-drugs.htm" title="Other drugs">Other drugs</a></li></ul></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="PHP2897-antiepileptic-drugs.htm">Previous: 4.8 Antiepileptic drugs</a> | <a class="top" href="PHP2898-control-of-the-epilepsies.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="PHP2905-focal-seizures-with-or-without-secondary-generalisation.htm">Next: Focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Cookie and Privacy Policy">Cookie and Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="PHP0-publication-information.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and Pharmaceutical Press 2012.
