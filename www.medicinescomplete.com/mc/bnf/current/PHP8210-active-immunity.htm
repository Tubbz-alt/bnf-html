Some inactivated vaccines are adsorbed onto an adjuvant (such as aluminium hydroxide) to enhance the antibody response.</p><div class="cI" id="PHP8211"><p>Advice in this chapter reflects that in the handbook <em>Immunisation against Infectious Disease</em> (2006), which in turn reflects the guidance of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).</p><p>Chapters from the handbook are available at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/immunisation">www.dh.gov.uk/immunisation</a></p><p>The advice in this chapter also incorporates changes announced by the Chief Medical Officer and Health Department Updates.</p></div><div id="PHP8212"><h2>Cautions</h2><p>Most individuals can safely receive the majority of vaccines. Vaccination may be postponed if the individual is suffering from an acute illness; however, it is not necessary to postpone immunisation in patients with minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset. See also Predisposition to Neurological Problems, below. For individuals with bleeding disorders, see Route of administration, below. If alcohol or disinfectant is used for cleansing the skin it should be allowed to evaporate before vaccination to prevent possible inactivation of live vaccines.</p><p>When 2 or more vaccines are required (and are not available as a combined preparation), they should be given simultaneously at different sites, preferably in a different limb; if more than one injection is to be given in the same limb, they should be administered at least 2.5 cm apart (but see also <a title="BNF:monograph-family: BCG vaccines" href="PHP8247-bcg-vaccines.htm">BCG Vaccines</a>). When 2 live vaccines cannot be given at the same time, they should be separated by an interval of at least 4 weeks. For <strong>interactions</strong> see Appendix 1 (vaccines).</p><p><em>See also</em> Cautions under individual vaccines </p></div><div id="PHP8219"><h2>Contra-indications</h2><p>Vaccines are contra-indicated in those who have a confirmed anaphylactic reaction to a preceding dose of a vaccine containing the same antigens or vaccine component (such as antibacterials in viral vaccines). The presence of the following excipients in vaccines and immunological products has been noted under the relevant entries:</p><div class="cI"> <div class="table" id="PHP8221"><table class="table" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8" border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 1pt solid ; border-bottom: 1pt solid ; border-left: 1pt solid ; border-right: 1pt solid ; "><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left;">Gelatin<br />Gentamicin<br />Kanamycin<br />Neomycin</td><td style="text-align: left;">Penicillins<br />Polymyxin B<br />Streptomycin<br />Thiomersal</td></tr></tbody></table></div> </div>  <p id="PHP8222"><em>Hypersensitivity to egg</em> Individuals with evidence of previous anaphylactic reaction to egg should not be given tick-borne encephalitis vaccine, and yellow fever vaccine should only be considered under the guidance of a specialist. Individuals with a history of egg allergy can be immunised with either an egg free influenza vaccine, if available, or an influenza vaccine with an ovalbumin content less than 120 nanograms/mL (facilities should be available to treat anaphylaxis). If an influenza vaccine containing ovalbumin is being considered in those with a history of anaphylaxis to egg or egg allergy with uncontrolled asthma, these individuals should be referred to a specialist in hospital.

Severely immunosuppressed patients should not be given live vaccines (including those with severe primary immunodeficiency). Specialist advice should be sought for those being treated with high doses of corticosteroids (dose equivalents of prednisolone: <strong>adults</strong>, at least 40 mg daily for more than 1 week; <strong>children</strong>, 2 mg/kg daily for at least 1 week or 1 mg/kg daily for 1 month), or other immunosuppressive drugs<cite><a href="PHP8210-active-immunity.htm#PHP10818" class="tooltip PHP10818">(1)</a></cite>, and those being treated for malignant conditions with chemotherapy or generalised radiotherapy<cite><a href="PHP8210-active-immunity.htm#PHP10818" class="tooltip PHP10818">(1)</a></cite><cite><a href="PHP8210-active-immunity.htm#PHP10819" class="tooltip PHP10819">(2)</a></cite>.

Termination of pregnancy following inadvertent immunisation is not recommended. There is no evidence of risk from vaccinating pregnant women with inactivated viral or bacterial vaccines or toxoids. For use of specific vaccines during pregnancy, see under individual vaccines.</p></div><div id="PHP8226"><h2>Breast-feeding</h2><p>Although there is a theoretical risk of live vaccine being present in breast milk, vaccination is not contra-indicated for women who are breast-feeding when there is significant risk of exposure to disease. There is no evidence of risk from vaccinating women who are breast-feeding, with inactivated viral or bacterial vaccines or toxoids. For use of specific vaccines during breast-feeding, see under individual vaccines.</p></div><div id="PHP8227"><h2>Side-effects</h2><p>Injection of a vaccine may be followed by local reactions such as pain, inflammation, redness, and lymphangitis. An induration or sterile abscess may develop at the injection site. Gastro-intestinal disturbances, fever, headache, irritability, loss of appetite, fatigue, myalgia, and malaise are among the most commonly reported side-effects. Other side-effects include influenza-like symptoms, dizziness, paraesthesia, asthenia, drowsiness, arthralgia, rash, and lymphadenopathy. Hypersensitivity reactions, such as bronchospasm, angioedema, urticaria, and anaphylaxis, are very rare but can be fatal (see <a title="monograph-family: Anaphylaxis" href="PHP1970-anaphylaxis.htm">section 3.4.3</a> for management of allergic emergencies).</p><p><strong>Oral</strong> vaccines such as cholera, live poliomyelitis, rotavirus, and live typhoid can also cause gastro-intestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and cramps, and diarrhoea.</p><p><em>See also</em> Predisposition to neurological problems, below.</p><p>Some vaccines (e.g. poliomyelitis) produce very few reactions, while others (e.g. measles, mumps and rubella) may cause a very mild form of the disease.

The parent should be warned to seek medical advice if the pyrexia persists.</p><p>For post-immunisation pyrexia in an infant aged 2–3 months, the dose of paracetamol is 60 mg; the dose of ibuprofen is 50 mg (on a doctor's advice). An oral syringe can be obtained from any pharmacy to give the small volume required.</p></div> <div class="cI" id="PHP8229"><h3 class="cT">Predisposition to neurological problems</h3><p> When there is a personal or family history of <em>febrile</em> convulsions, there is an increased risk of these occurring during fever from any cause including immunisation, but this is not a contra-indication to immunisation. In children who have had a seizure associated with fever without neurological deterioration, immunisation is <em>recommended</em>; advice on the <em>management of fever</em> (see Post-immunisation pyrexia in infants, above) should be given before immunisation. When a child has had a convulsion not associated with fever, and the neurological condition is not deteriorating, immunisation is <em>recommended</em>.</p><p>Children with stable neurological disorders (e.g. spina bifida, congenital brain abnormality, and perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy) should be immunised according to the recommended schedule.</p><p>When there is a <em>still evolving neurological problem</em>, including poorly controlled epilepsy, immunisation should be <em>deferred</em> and the child referred to a specialist. Immunisation is recommended if a cause for the neurological disorder is identified. If a cause is not identified, immunisation should be deferred until the condition is stable.</p></div>  <p>Further information on adverse effects associated with specific vaccines can be found under individual vaccines.</p></div><div id="PHP8230"><h2>Vaccines and HIV infection</h2><p>HIV-positive individuals with or without symptoms can receive the following live vaccines:</p><ul class="cW"><li><p>MMR (but avoid if immunity significantly impaired), varicella-zoster (but avoid if immunity significantly impaired—consult product literature);<cite><a href="PHP8210-active-immunity.htm#PHP10819" class="tooltip PHP10819">(2)</a></cite></p> </li></ul><p>and the following inactivated vaccines:</p><ul class="cW"><li><p>anthrax, cholera (oral), diphtheria, haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, human papilloma virus, influenza (injection), meningococcal, pertussis, pneumococcal, poliomyelitis, rabies, tetanus, tick-borne encephalitis, typhoid (injection).</p> </li></ul><p>HIV-positive individuals should <strong>not </strong>receive:</p><ul class="cW"><li><p>BCG, influenza (nasal spray), typhoid (oral), yellow fever<cite><a href="PHP8210-active-immunity.htm#ID0EABABDBA" class="tooltip ID0EABABDBA">(3)</a></cite></p> </li></ul><div class="cF"><div class="cE"><h3 class="cT">Note</h3> <p class="cT">The above advice differs from that for other immunocompromised patients; <em>Immunisation Guidelines for HIV-infected Adults</em> issued by <em>British HIV Association</em> (BHIVA) are available at <a href="http://www.bhiva.org">www.bhiva.org</a> and, <em>Immunisation of HIV-infected Children</em> issued by <em>Children's HIV Association</em> (CHIVA) are available at <a href="http://www.chiva.org.uk">www.chiva.org.uk</a></p></div></div></div><div id="PHP8235"><h2>Vaccines and asplenia</h2><p>The following vaccines are recommended for asplenic patients or those with splenic dysfunction:</p><ul class="cW"><li><p>haemophilus influenzae type b; influenza; meningococcal A, C, W135, and Y conjugate; pneumococcal.</p> </li></ul><p>For antibiotic prophylaxis in asplenia see <a title="sub-topic: Prevention of pneumococcal infection in asplenia or in patients with sickle cell disease" href="PHP3284-prevention-of-pneumococcal-infection-in-asplenia-or-in-patients-with-sickle-cell-disease.htm">Table 2.
