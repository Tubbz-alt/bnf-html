Belimumab is licensed as adjunctive therapy in patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus with a high degree of disease activity despite standard therapy. Infusion-related side-effects are reported commonly with belimumab, including severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity and infusion reactions. These occur predominantly during the first 2 infusions. Delay in the onset of acute hypersensitivity reactions has been observed; patients should remain under clinical supervision for several hours following at least the first 2 infusions. Premedication with an antihistamine, with or without an antipyretic, may be considered.</p><p id="PHP6624"><strong>Tocilizumab</strong> antagonises the actions of interleukin-6. Tocilizumab is licensed for use in patients with moderate to severe active <em>rheumatoid arthritis</em> when response to at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug or tumour necrosis factor inhibitor has been inadequate, or in those who are intolerant of these drugs. Tocilizumab can be used in combination with methotrexate, or as monotherapy if methotrexate is not tolerated or is contra-indicated (see also NICE guidance below). It is also licensed for the management of active systemic <em>juvenile idiopathic arthritis</em> when there has been an inadequate response to NSAIDs and systemic corticosteroids. Tocilizumab can be used in combination with methotrexate, or as monotherapy if methotrexate is not tolerated or is contra-indicated (see also NICE guidance below). </p><p>The <a title="NICE and Scottish Medicines Consortium" href="PHP60-general-guidance.htm#PHP70"><em>Scottish Medicines Consortium</em></a> has advised (March 2012) that tocilizumab (<em>RoActemra</em>®) is <strong>not</strong> recommended for use within NHS Scotland as monotherapy in patients who are intolerant to methotrexate or where continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate, for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying
