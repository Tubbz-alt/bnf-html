Manufacturers' product literature, hospital-trust protocols, and cancer-network protocols should be consulted for full details of side-effects associated with individual drugs and specific chemotherapy regimes.</p><p>Many side-effects of cytotoxic drugs often do not occur at the time of administration, but days or weeks later. It is therefore important that patients and healthcare professionals can identify symptoms that cause concern and can contact an expert for advice. Toxicities should be accurately recorded using a recognised scoring system such as the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) developed by the National Cancer Institute. </p><div><h2>Extravasation of intravenous drugs</h2><p>A number of cytotoxic drugs will cause severe local tissue necrosis if leakage into the extravascular compartment occurs. To reduce the risk of extravasation injury it is recommended that cytotoxic drugs are administered by appropriately trained staff. For information on the prevention and management of extravasation injury, see <a title="BNF:topic: Extravasation" href="PHP6743-extravasation.htm">section 10.3</a>.</p></div><div id="PHP5185"><h2>Oral mucositis</h2><p>A sore mouth is a common complication of cancer chemotherapy; it is most often associated with fluorouracil, methotrexate, and the anthracyclines. It is best to prevent the complication. Good oral hygiene (rinsing the mouth frequently and effective brushing of the teeth with a soft brush 2–3 times daily) is probably beneficial. For fluorouracil, sucking ice chips during short infusions of the drug is also helpful.</p>  <p>Once a sore mouth has developed, treatment is much less effective. Saline mouthwashes should be used but there is no good evidence to support the use of antiseptic or anti-inflammatory mouthwashes. In general, mucositis is self-limiting but with poor oral hygiene it can be a focus for blood-borne infection.</p> </div><div id="PHP5186"><h2>Tumour lysis syndrome</h2><p>Tumour lysis syndrome occurs secondary to spontaneous or treatment-related rapid destruction of malignant cells. Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome include those with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (especially if high grade and bulky disease), Burkitt's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia (particularly if high white blood cell counts or bulky disease), and occasionally those with solid tumours. Pre-existing hyperuricaemia, dehydration, and renal impairment are also predisposing factors. Features include hyperkalaemia, hyperuricaemia (see below), and hyperphosphataemia with hypocalcaemia; renal damage and arrhythmias can follow. Early identification of patients at risk, and initiation of prophylaxis or therapy for tumour lysis syndrome, is essential.</p></div><div id="PHP5187"><h2>Hyperuricaemia</h2><p>Hyperuricaemia, which may be present in high-grade lymphoma and leukaemia, can be markedly worsened by chemotherapy and is associated with acute renal failure. Allopurinol (<a title=" Drugs for treatment of gout" href="PHP6660-gout-and-cytotoxic-induced-hyperuricaemia.htm">section 10.1.4</a>) should be started 24 hours before treating such tumours and patients should be adequately hydrated. The dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be reduced if allopurinol needs to be given concomitantly (see Appendix 1).</p>  <p>Rasburicase (section 10.1.4), a recombinant urate oxidase, is licensed for hyperuricaemia in patients with haematological malignancy, for details, see <a title="target-block: rasburicase" href="PHP6683-hyperuricaemia-associated-with-cytotoxic-drugs.htm#PHP6684">Hyperuricaemia Associated With Cytotoxic Drugs</a>. It rapidly reduces plasma-uric acid concentration and may be of particular value in preventing complications following treatment of leukaemias or bulky lymphomas.</p> </div><div id="PHP5192"><h2>Nausea and vomiting</h2><p>Nausea and vomiting cause considerable distress to many patients who receive chemotherapy and to a lesser extent abdominal radiotherapy, and may lead to refusal of further treatment; prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting is therefore extremely important. Symptoms may be acute (occurring within 24 hours of treatment), delayed (first occurring more than 24 hours after treatment), or anticipatory (occurring prior to subsequent doses). Delayed and anticipatory symptoms are more difficult to control than acute symptoms and require different management.</p><p>Patients vary in their susceptibility to drug-induced nausea and vomiting; those affected more often include women, patients under 50 years of age, anxious patients, and those who experience motion sickness. Susceptibility also increases with repeated exposure to the cytotoxic drug.</p><p>Drugs may be divided according to their emetogenic potential and some examples are given below, but the symptoms vary according to the dose, to other drugs administered and to individual susceptibility.</p><p><em>Mildly emetogenic treatment</em>—fluorouracil, etoposide, methotrexate (less than 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), the vinca alkaloids, and abdominal radiotherapy. </p><p><em>Moderately emetogenic treatment</em>—the taxanes, doxorubicin, intermediate and low doses of cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and high doses of methotrexate (0.1–1.2 g/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p><em>Highly emetogenic treatment</em>—cisplatin, dacarbazine, and high doses of cyclophosphamide.</p><div><div class="cE"><h3 class="cT">Prevention of acute symptoms</h3> <p class="cT">For patients at <em>low risk of emesis</em>, pretreatment with domperidone or with metoclopramide, continued for up to 24 hours after chemotherapy, is often effective (<a title=" Drugs used in nausea and vertigo" href="PHP2505-drugs-used-in-nausea-and-vertigo.htm">section 4.6</a>). If metoclopramide or domperidone are not sufficiently effective, additional drugs such as dexamethasone (6–10 mg by mouth) or lorazepam (1–2 mg by mouth) may be used.</p></div><p>For patients at <em>high risk of emesis</em>, a 5HT<sub>3</sub>-receptor antagonist (<a title="monograph-family: 5HT_3 antagonists" href="PHP2555-5ht-3-receptor-antagonists.htm">section 4.6</a>), usually given by mouth in combination with dexamethasone and the neurokinin receptor antagonist aprepitant is effective.</p></div><div><div class="cE"><h3 class="cT">Prevention of delayed symptoms</h3> <p class="cT">For delayed symptoms associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, a combination of dexamethasone and 5HT<sub>3</sub>-receptor antagonist is effective; for highly emetogenic chemotherapy, a combination of dexamethasone and aprepitant is effective.</p></div></div><div><div class="cE"><h3 class="cT">Prevention of anticipatory symptoms</h3> <p class="cT">Good symptom control is the best way to prevent anticipatory symptoms. Lorazepam can be helpful for its amnesic, sedative, and anxiolytic effects.</p></div></div></div><div id="PHP5193"><h2>Bone-marrow suppression</h2><p>All cytotoxic drugs except vincristine and bleomycin cause bone-marrow suppression. This commonly occurs 7 to 10 days after administration, but is delayed for certain drugs, such as carmustine, lomustine, and melphalan. Peripheral blood counts must be checked before each treatment, and doses should be reduced or therapy delayed if bone-marrow has not recovered.</p>  <p>Cytotoxic drugs may be contra-indicated in patients with acute infection; any infection should be treated before, or when starting, cytotoxic drugs.</p>  <p>Fever in a neutropenic patient (neutrophil count less than 1.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/litre) requires immediate broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. Appropriate bacteriological investigations should be conducted as soon as possible. Patients taking cytotoxic drugs who have signs or symptoms of infection should be advised to seek prompt medical attention. All patients should initially be investigated and treated under the supervision of the appropriate oncology or haematology specialist.</p>  <p>In selected patients, the duration and the severity of neutropenia can be reduced by the use of amifostine or recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, <a title=" Drugs used in neutropenia" href="PHP5939-drugs-used-in-neutropenia.htm">section 9.1.6</a>.</p>  <p>Symptomatic anaemia is usually treated with red blood cell transfusions. For guidance on the use of erythropoietins in patients with cancer, see <a title="target-block: Erythropoietins MHRA/CHM advice (target haemoglobin concentration)" href="PHP5880-erythropoietins.htm#PHP5882">MHRA/CHM advice</a> and <a title="target-block: Erythropoietins NICE guidance cancer-related anaemia" href="PHP5880-erythropoietins.htm#PHP5885">NICE guidance</a>.</p> </div><p>For advice on the use of live vaccines in individuals with impaired immune response, see <a title="BNF:target-block: contra-indications" href="PHP8210-active-immunity.htm#PHP8219">section 14.1</a>.</p><div><h2>Alopecia</h2><p> Reversible hair loss is a common complication, although it varies in degree between drugs and individual patients. No pharmacological methods of preventing this are available.</p></div><div id="PHP5194"><h2>Pregnancy and reproductive function</h2><p id="PHP18365">Most cytotoxic drugs are teratogenic and should not be administered during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Exclude pregnancy before treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Considerable caution is necessary if a pregnant woman presents with cancer requiring chemotherapy, and specialist advice should always be sought.</p><p>Contraceptive advice should be given to men and women before cytotoxic therapy begins (and should cover the duration of contraception required after therapy has ended).</p><p>Regimens that do not contain an alkylating drug or procarbazine may have less effect on fertility, but those with an alkylating drug or procarbazine carry the risk of causing permanent male sterility (there is no effect on potency). Pretreatment counselling and consideration of sperm storage may be appropriate. Women are less severely affected, though the span of reproductive life may be shortened by the onset of a premature menopause. No increase in fetal abnormalities or abortion rate has been recorded in patients who remain fertile after cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p></div><div id="PHP5198"><h2>Thromboembolism</h2><p>Venous thromboembolism can be a complication of cancer itself, but chemotherapy increases the risk.</p> </div></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="PHP5180-cytotoxic-drugs.htm">Previous: 8.1 Cytotoxic drugs</a> | <a class="top" href="PHP5183-side-effects-of-cytotoxic-drugs.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="PHP5199-treatment-for-cytotoxic-induced-side-effects.htm">Next: Treatment for cytotoxic-induced side-effects</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Cookie and Privacy Policy">Cookie and Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="PHP0-publication-information.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and Pharmaceutical Press 2012.
