However many of these preparations can produce a slowing of reaction time and a loss of mental concentration that can have the same effects as drowsiness.</p><p>Avoidance of alcoholic drink is recommended because the effects of CNS depressants are enhanced by alcohol. Strict prohibition however could lead to some patients not taking the medicine. Pharmacists should therefore explain the risk and encourage compliance, particularly in patients who may think they already tolerate the effects of alcohol (see also label 3). Queries from patients with epilepsy regarding fitness to drive should be referred back to the patient's doctor.</p><p>Side-effects unrelated to drowsiness that may affect a patient's ability to drive or operate machinery safely include <em>blurred vision, dizziness, or nausea</em>.
