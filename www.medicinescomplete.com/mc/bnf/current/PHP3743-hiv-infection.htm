Drugs for HIV infection (antiretrovirals) may be associated with serious side-effects. Although antiretrovirals increase life expectancy considerably and decrease the risk of complications associated with premature ageing, mortality and morbidity remain slightly higher than in uninfected individuals. Treatment should be undertaken only by those experienced in their use.</p><div><h2>Principles of treatment</h2><p>Treatment aims to prevent the mortality and morbidity associated with chronic HIV infection whilst minimising drug toxicity. Although it should be started before the immune system is irreversibly damaged, the need for early drug treatment should be balanced against the risk of toxicity. Commitment to treatment and strict adherence over many years are required; the regimen chosen should take into account convenience and patient tolerance. The development of drug resistance is reduced by using a combination of drugs; such combinations should have synergistic or additive activity while ensuring that their toxicity is not additive. It is recommended that viral sensitivity to antiretroviral drugs is established before starting treatment or before switching drugs if the infection is not responding.</p> Treatment also reduces the risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners, but the risk is not eliminated completely, therefore, other methods to reduce transmission should continue to be recommended. </div><div><h2>Initiation of treatment</h2><p>The optimum time for initiating antiretroviral treatment depends primarily on the CD4 cell count. The timing and choice of treatment should also take account of clinical symptoms, co-morbidities, and the possible effect of antiretroviral drugs on factors such as the risk of cardiovascular events. Treatment includes a combination of drugs known as ‘highly active antiretroviral therapy’. Treatment of HIV-1 infection is initiated with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and <em>either</em> a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, <em>or</em> a boosted protease inhibitor, <em>or</em> an integrase inhibitor; the regimens of choice contain tenofovir and emtricitabine with <em>either</em> efavirenz <em>or</em> ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, <em>or</em> ritonavir-boosted darunavir, <em>or</em> raltegravir. Alternative regimens contain abacavir and lamivudine with <em>either</em> ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, <em>or</em> ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir, <em>or</em> nevirapine, <em>or</em> rilpivirine. Patients who require treatment for both HIV and chronic hepatitis B should be treated with antivirals active against both diseases (<a title="BNF:sub-sub-section: Chronic hepatitis B" href="PHP3869-chronic-hepatitis-b.htm">section 5.3.3.1</a>).</p></div><div><h2>Switching therapy</h2><p>Deterioration of the condition (including clinical and virological changes) may require a change in therapy. The choice of an alternative regimen depends on factors such as the response to previous treatment, tolerance and the possibility of cross-resistance.</p></div><div id="PHP3744"><h2>Pregnancy</h2><p>Treatment of HIV infection in pregnancy aims to reduce the risk of toxicity to the fetus (although the teratogenic potential of most antiretroviral drugs is unknown), to minimise the viral load and disease progression in the mother, and to prevent transmission of infection to the neonate. <strong>All treatment options require careful assessment by a specialist</strong>. Zidovudine monotherapy reduces transmission of infection to the neonate. However, combination antiretroviral therapy maximises the chance of preventing transmission and represents optimal therapy for the mother. Combination antiretroviral therapy may be associated with a greater risk of preterm delivery.</p></div><div id="PHP3745"><h2>Breast-feeding</h2><p>Breast-feeding by HIV-positive mothers may cause HIV infection in the infant and should be avoided.</p></div><div><h2>Children</h2><p>HIV disease in children has a different natural progression to adults. Children infected with HIV should be managed within a formal paediatric HIV clinical network by specialists with access to guidelines and information on antiretroviral drugs for children.</p></div><div><h2>Post-exposure prophylaxis</h2><p>Prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs [unlicensed indication] may be appropriate following exposure to HIV-contaminated material. Immediate expert advice should be sought in such cases; national guidelines on post-exposure prophylaxis for healthcare workers have been developed (by the Chief Medical Officer's Expert Advisory Group on AIDS, <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">www.dh.gov.uk</a>) and local ones may also be available. Antiretrovirals for prophylaxis are chosen on the basis of efficacy and potential for toxicity. Prompt prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs [unlicensed indication] is also appropriate following potential sexual exposure to HIV; recommendations have been developed by the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, <a href="http://www.bashh.org">www.bashh.org</a></p></div><div><h2>Drugs for HIV infection</h2><p><strong>Zidovudine</strong>, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (or ‘nucleoside analogue’), was the first anti-HIV drug to be introduced. Other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors include <strong>abacavir</strong>, <strong>didanosine</strong>, <strong>emtricitabine</strong>, <strong>lamivudine</strong>, <strong>stavudine</strong>, and <strong>tenofovir</strong>.</p><p>The protease inhibitors include <strong>atazanavir</strong>, <strong>darunavir</strong>, <strong>fosamprenavir</strong> (a pro-drug of amprenavir), <strong>indinavir</strong>, <strong>lopinavir</strong>, <strong>nelfinavir</strong>, <strong>ritonavir</strong>, <strong>saquinavir</strong>, and <strong>tipranavir</strong>. Indinavir is rarely used in the treatment of HIV-infection because it is associated with nephrolithiasis. Ritonavir in low doses boosts the activity of atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir increasing the persistence of plasma concentrations of these drugs; at such a low dose, ritonavir has no intrinsic antiviral activity. A combination of lopinavir with low-dose ritonavir is available. The protease inhibitors are metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems and therefore have a significant potential for drug interactions. Protease inhibitors are associated with lipodystrophy and metabolic effects (see below).</p><p>The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors <strong>efavirenz</strong>, <strong>etravirine</strong>, <strong>nevirapine, </strong>and <strong>rilpivirine</strong> are used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, but not against the subtype HIV-2, a subtype that is rare in the UK. Nevirapine is associated with a high incidence of rash (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and occasionally fatal hepatitis. Rash is also associated with efavirenz and etravirine but it is usually milder. Psychiatric or CNS disturbances are common with efavirenz; CNS disturbances are often self-limiting and can be reduced by taking the dose at bedtime (especially in the first 2–4 weeks of treatment). Efavirenz has also been associated with an increased plasma-cholesterol concentration. Etravirine is used in regimens containing a boosted protease inhibitor for HIV infection resistant to other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors.</p><p><strong>Enfuvirtide</strong>, which inhibits the fusion of HIV to the host cell, is licensed for managing infection that has failed to respond to a regimen of other antiretroviral drugs; enfuvirtide should be combined with other potentially active antiretroviral drugs.</p><p><strong>Maraviroc</strong> is an antagonist of the CCR5 chemokine receptor. It is licensed for patients exclusively infected with CCR5-tropic HIV. The <a title="target-block: NICE and Scottish Medicines Consortium" href="PHP60-general-guidance.htm#PHP70"><em>Scottish Medicines Consortium</em></a> has advised (March 2008) that maraviroc (<em>Celsentri</em>®) is <strong>not</strong> recommended for use within NHS Scotland.</p><p><strong>Raltegravir</strong> is an inhibitor of HIV integrase. It is licensed for the treatment of HIV infection in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. The <a title="target-block: NICE and Scottish Medicines Consortium" href="PHP60-general-guidance.htm#PHP70"><em>Scottish Medicines Consortium</em></a> has advised (April 2010) that raltegravir (<em>Isentress</em>®) is accepted for restricted use within NHS Scotland for the treatment of HIV infection when non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors cannot be used because of intolerance, drug interactions, or resistance.</p></div><div><h2>Immune reconstitution syndrome</h2><p>Improvement in immune function as a result of antiretroviral treatment may provoke a marked inflammatory reaction against residual opportunistic organisms.</p></div><div id="PHP3746"><h2>Lipodystrophy syndrome</h2><p> Metabolic effects associated with antiretroviral treatment include <em>fat redistribution</em>, <em>insulin resistance</em>, and <em>dyslipidaemia</em>; collectively these have been termed <em>lipodystrophy syndrome</em>. The usual risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be taken into account before starting antiretroviral therapy and patients should be advised about lifestyle changes to reduce their cardiovascular risk. Plasma lipids and blood glucose should be measured before starting antiretroviral therapy, after 3–6 months of treatment, and then annually.</p><p>Fat redistribution (with loss of subcutaneous fat, increased abdominal fat, ‘buffalo hump’ and breast enlargement) is associated with regimens containing protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Stavudine (especially in combination with didanosine), and to a lesser extent zidovudine, are associated with a higher risk of lipoatrophy and should be used only if alternative regimens are not suitable.</p><p>Dyslipidaemia is associated with antiretroviral treatment, particularly with protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors and some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are associated with insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia. Of the protease inhibitors, atazanavir and darunavir may be less likely to cause dyslipidaemia, while saquinavir and atazanavir may be less likely to impair glucose tolerance.</p></div><div id="PHP3747"><h2>Osteonecrosis</h2><p>Osteonecrosis has been reported in patients with advanced HIV disease or following long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy.</p></div></div><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li id="_PHP3748-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors"><a href="PHP3748-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors.htm" title="Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors">Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</a></li><li id="_PHP3794-protease-inhibitors"><a href="PHP3794-protease-inhibitors.htm" title="Protease inhibitors">Protease inhibitors</a></li><li id="_PHP3821-non-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors"><a href="PHP3821-non-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors.htm" title="Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors">Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</a></li><li id="_PHP3831-other-antiretrovirals"><a href="PHP3831-other-antiretrovirals.htm" title="Other antiretrovirals">Other antiretrovirals</a></li></ul></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="PHP3742-antiviral-drugs.htm">Previous: 5.3 Antiviral drugs</a> | <a class="top" href="PHP3743-hiv-infection.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="PHP3748-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors.htm">Next: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Cookie and Privacy Policy">Cookie and Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="PHP0-publication-information.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and Pharmaceutical Press 2012.
