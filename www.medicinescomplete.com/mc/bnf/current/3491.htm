pain particularly of visceral origin. Repeated administration may cause dependence and
tolerance, but this is no deterrent in the control of pain in terminal
illness, for guidelines see <a title="prelim-section: Prescribing in palliative care" href="29446.htm#_29446">Prescribing in Palliative
Care</a>.
Regular use of a potent opioid may be appropriate for certain cases
of chronic non-malignant pain; treatment should be supervised by a
specialist and the patient should be assessed at regular intervals.</p><div id="_200091"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Cautions</h2> <p class="cAX"><span id="_200532">Opioids should
be used with caution in patients with impaired respiratory
function (avoid in chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease) and asthma (avoid
during an acute attack), hypotension, urethral stenosis, shock, myasthenia gravis, prostatic
hypertrophy, obstructive or inflammatory
bowel disorders, diseases of the biliary
tract, and convulsive disorders. A reduced dose is recommended in elderly or debilitated patients, in hypothyroidism, and in adrenocortical
insufficiency. Repeated use of opioid analgesics is associated with
the development of psychological and physical dependence; although
this is rarely a problem with therapeutic use, caution is advised
if prescribing for patients with a history of drug dependence. Avoid abrupt withdrawal after long-term treatment. Transdermal preparations (fentanyl or buprenorphine patches) are
not suitable for acute pain or in those patients whose analgesic requirements
are changing rapidly because the long time to steady state prevents
rapid titration of the dose. <b>Interactions</b>: Appendix
1 (opioid analgesics; <b>important:</b> special hazard with <i>pethidine and possibly other opioids</i> and MAOIs).</span></p><div class="cAR"><h3>Palliative care</h3> <p class="cAX">In the control of pain in terminal
illness, the cautions listed above should not necessarily be a deterrent
to the use of opioid analgesics.</p></div></div></div><div id="_201074"></div><div id="_200093"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Contra-indications</h2> <p class="cAX">Opioid analgesics should be
avoided in patients with acute respiratory depression and when there is a risk of paralytic ileus. They are also contra-indicated in conditions associated
with raised intracranial pressure and in head
injury (opioid analgesics interfere with pupillary responses
vital for neurological assessment). Comatose patients should not be treated with opioid analgesics.</p></div></div><div id="_204134"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Hepatic impairment</h2> <p class="cAX">Opioid analgesics may precipitate
coma in patients with hepatic impairment; avoid use or reduce dose.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Renal impairment</h2> <p class="cAX">The effects of opioid analgesia
are increased and prolonged and there is increased cerebral sensitivity
when patients with renal impairment are treated with opioid analgesics;
avoid use or reduce dose.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Pregnancy</h2> <p class="cAX">Respiratory depression and withdrawal
symptoms can occur in the neonate if opioid analgesics are used during
delivery; also gastric stasis and inhalation pneumonia has been reported
in the mother if opioid analgesics are used during labour.</p></div></div><div id="_200095"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Side-effects</h2> <p class="cAX">Opioid <span>analgesics</span> share many side-effects, although qualitative and quantitative differences
exist. The most common side-effects include nausea and vomiting (particularly
in initial stages), constipation, dry mouth, and biliary spasm; larger
doses produce muscle rigidity, hypotension, and respiratory depression
(for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression, see <a title="sub-section: Antagonists for central and respiratory depression" href="6672.htm#_6672">section 15.1.7</a>). Other
common side-effects of opioid analgesics include bradycardia, tachycardia,
palpitation, oedema, postural hypotension, hallucinations, vertigo,
euphoria, dysphoria, mood changes, dependence, dizziness, confusion,
drowsiness, sleep disturbances, headache, sexual dysfunction, difficulty
with micturition, urinary retention, ureteric spasm, miosis, visual
disturbances, sweating, flushing, rash, urticaria, and pruritus. <b>Overdosage</b>: see <a title="monograph-family: Analgesics (opioid)" href="29532.htm#_29532">Emergency Treatment of Poisoning</a>.</p><p>Long-term use of opioid analgesics can cause hypogonadism and
adrenal insufficiency in both men and women. This is thought to be
dose related and can lead to amenorrhoea, reduced libido, infertility,
depression, and erectile dysfunction. Long-term use of opioid analgesics
has also been associated with a state of abnormal pain sensitivity
(hyperalgesia). Pain associated with hyperalgesia is usually distinct
from pain associated with disease progression or breakthrough pain,
and is often more diffuse and less defined. Treatment of hyperalgesia
involves reducing the dose of opioid medication or switching therapy;
cases of suspected hyperalgesia should be referred to a specialist
pain team.</p></div></div><div class="cAZ" id="_3491.2"><h2>Driving</h2> <p class="cAX">Drowsiness
may affect performance of skilled tasks (e.g. driving); effects of <span>alcohol</span> enhanced. Driving at the start of therapy with opioid analgesics,
and following dose changes, should be avoided.</p></div><div class="cAZ" id="_200370"><h2>Strong opioids</h2> <p class="cAX"><b><span>Morphine</span></b> remains the most valuable opioid analgesic for severe pain although
it frequently causes nausea and vomiting. It is the standard against
which other opioid <span>analgesics</span> are compared. In
addition to relief of pain, <span>morphine</span> also confers
a state of euphoria and mental detachment. </p><p><span>Morphine</span> is the opioid of choice for the
oral treatment of <i>severe pain in palliative care</i>.
It is given regularly every 4 hours (or every 12 or 24 hours as modified-release
preparations). For guidelines on dosage adjustment in palliative care,
see <a title="prelim-section: Prescribing in palliative care" href="29446.htm#_29446">Prescribing in Palliative
Care</a>.</p><p>A modified-release epidural preparation of morphine is available
from Flynn Pharma Ltd (<span class="cZ">Depodur</span>®<a href="204285.htm" title="Report adverse reaction(s)"><img class="cK" src="images/blacktri_l.png" alt="Black triangle" /></a>).</p> <p class="cAX"><b><span>Buprenorphine</span></b> has both opioid agonist and antagonist properties and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms, including pain, in patients
dependent on other opioids. It has abuse
potential and may itself cause dependence. It has a much longer duration of action than <span>morphine</span> and sublingually is an effective analgesic for 6 to 8 hours. Unlike
most opioid <span>analgesics</span>, the effects of buprenorphine
are only partially reversed by naloxone.</p><p><span id="_3491.12"><b>Dipipanone</b> used alone is less sedating than <span>morphine</span> but
the only preparation available contains an antiemetic and is therefore
not suitable for regular regimens in palliative care.</span></p><p><b><span>Diamorphine</span></b> (heroin) is a powerful opioid analgesic. It may cause less nausea
and hypotension than <span>morphine</span>. In <i>palliative care</i> the greater solubility of diamorphine allows effective doses to
be injected in smaller volumes and this is important in the emaciated
patient.</p><p><b><span>Alfentanil</span></b>, <b><span>fentanyl</span></b> and <b><span>remifentanil</span></b> are used by injection for intra-operative analgesia (<a title=" Opioid analgesics" href="6621.htm#_6621">section 15.1.4.3</a>); <span>fentanyl</span> is available
in a transdermal drug delivery system as a self-adhesive patch which
is changed every 72 hours.</p><p><b>Methadone</b> is less sedating than <span>morphine</span> and acts for longer
periods. <span id="_3491.11">In prolonged use, methadone should not be administered more often
than twice daily to avoid the risk of accumulation and opioid overdosage</span>. Methadone may be used instead of <span>morphine</span> in the occasional patient who experiences excitation (or exacerbation
of pain) with <span>morphine</span>.</p><p><b>Oxycodone</b> has an efficacy and side-effect profile similar
to that of <span>morphine</span>. It is used primarily for control
of <i>pain in palliative care</i>.</p><p><b>Papaveretum</b> is rarely used; morphine is easier
to prescribe and less prone to error with regard to the strength and
dose.</p><div id="_3491.10"> <p class="cAX"><b><span>Pentazocine</span></b> has both agonist and antagonist properties and precipitates
withdrawal symptoms, including pain in patients dependent on other
opioids. By injection it is more potent than dihydrocodeine or codeine,
but hallucinations and thought disturbances may occur. It is not recommended
and, in particular, should be avoided after myocardial infarction
as it may increase pulmonary and aortic blood pressure as well as
cardiac work.</p></div><p><b>Pethidine</b> produces prompt but short-lasting analgesia;
it is less constipating than <span>morphine</span>, but even
in high doses is a less potent analgesic. It is not suitable for severe
continuing pain. It is used for analgesia in labour; however, other opioids, such
as <span>morphine</span> or diamorphine, are often preferred
for obstetric
pain.</p><p><b>Tapentadol</b> produces analgesia by two mechanisms. It is an opioid-receptor agonist
and it also inhibits noradrenaline reuptake. Nausea, vomiting, and
constipation are less likely to occur with tapentadol than with other
strong opioid analgesics.</p><p><b>Tramadol</b> produces analgesia by two mechanisms: an opioid effect and an enhancement
of serotonergic and adrenergic pathways. It has fewer of the typical
opioid side-effects (notably, less respiratory depression, less constipation
and less addiction potential); psychiatric reactions have been reported.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Weak opioids</h2> <p class="cAX"><b>Codeine</b> is used for the relief of mild to moderate
pain but is too constipating for long-term use.</p><p><b>Dihydrocodeine</b> has an analgesic efficacy similar to that of codeine. The dose of
dihydrocodeine by mouth is usually 30 mg every 4 hours; doubling the
dose to 60 mg may provide some additional pain relief but this may
be at the cost of more nausea and vomiting. A 40-mg tablet is also
available.</p><p><b><span>Meptazinol</span></b> is claimed to have a low incidence
of respiratory depression. It has a reported length of action of 2
to 7 hours with onset within 15 minutes.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Dose</h2> <p class="cAX">The dose of opioids in the BNF may need to
be <b>adjusted individually</b> according to the degree
of analgesia and side-effects; patients’ response to opioids varies
widely.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Postoperative analgesia</h2> <p class="cAX">A combination of opioid and non-opioid
analgesics (<a title="BNF:sub-section: Non-opioid analgesics" href="3457.htm#_3457">section 4.7.1</a> and <a title="BNF:sub-sub-section: Non-opioid analgesics" href="6618.htm#_6618">section 15.1.4.2</a>) is
used to treat postoperative pain. The use of intra-operative opioids
affects the prescribing of postoperative <span>analgesics</span>. A postoperative opioid analgesic should be given with
care since it may potentiate any residual respiratory depression (for the treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression, see <a title=" Antagonists for central and respiratory depression" href="6672.htm#_6672">section 15.1.7</a>).</p><p><b><span>Morphine</span></b> is used most widely. <b>Tramadol</b> is not as effective in severe pain as other opioid <span>analgesics</span>. <b><span>Buprenorphine</span></b> may antagonise
the analgesic effect of previously administered opioids and is generally
not recommended. <b>Pethidine</b> is generally not recommended for postoperative
pain because it is metabolised to norpethidine which may accumulate,
particularly in renal impairment; norpethidine stimulates the central
nervous system and may cause convulsions.</p><p>Opioids are also given epidurally [unlicensed route] in the
postoperative period but are associated with side-effects such as
pruritus, urinary retention, nausea and vomiting; respiratory depression
can be delayed, particularly with <span>morphine</span>.</p><p>For details of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) to relieve
postoperative pain, consult hospital protocols. Formulations specifically
designed for PCA are available (<span class="cZ">Pharma-Ject</span>® <i><span>Morphine</span> Sulphate</i>).</p></div><div id="_3491.1"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Dental and orofacial pain</h2> <p class="cAX">Opioid
analgesics are <b>relatively ineffective</b> in dental pain.
Like other opioids, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> often causes nausea
and vomiting which limits its value in dental pain; if taken for more
than a few doses it is also liable to cause constipation. Dihydrocodeine
is not very effective in postoperative dental pain.</p><p>For the management of dental and orofacial pain, see <a title="target-block: Dental pain 4.7" href="3456.htm#_3456.5">section 4.7</a>.</p></div></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Pain management and opioid dependence</h2> <p class="cAX">Although
caution is necessary, patients who are dependent on opioids or have
a history of drug dependence may be treated with opioid analgesics
when there is a clinical need. Treatment with opioid analgesics in
this patient group should normally be carried out with the advice
of specialists. However, doctors do not require a special licence
to prescribe opioid analgesics to patients with opioid dependence
for relief of pain due to organic disease or injury.</p></div></div></div><?highlighter on?><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li id="_3512"><a href="3512.htm" title="BUPRENORPHINE">BUPRENORPHINE</a></li><li id="_3514"><a href="3514.htm" title="CODEINE PHOSPHATE">CODEINE PHOSPHATE</a></li><li id="_3521"><a href="3521.htm" title="DIAMORPHINE HYDROCHLORIDE">DIAMORPHINE HYDROCHLORIDE</a></li><li id="_3524"><a href="3524.htm" title="DIHYDROCODEINE TARTRATE">DIHYDROCODEINE TARTRATE</a></li><li id="_3528"><a href="3528.htm" title="DIPIPANONE HYDROCHLORIDE">DIPIPANONE HYDROCHLORIDE</a></li><li id="_3530"><a href="3530.htm" title="FENTANYL">FENTANYL</a></li><li id="_65271"><a href="65271.htm" title="HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE">HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE</a></li><li id="_3531"><a href="3531.htm" title="MEPTAZINOL">MEPTAZINOL</a></li><li id="_3533"><a href="3533.htm" title="METHADONE HYDROCHLORIDE">METHADONE HYDROCHLORIDE</a></li><li id="_3492"><a href="3492.htm" title="MORPHINE SALTS">MORPHINE SALTS</a></li><li id="_85406"><a href="85406.htm" title="OXYCODONE HYDROCHLORIDE">OXYCODONE HYDROCHLORIDE</a></li><li id="_213821"><a href="213821.htm" title="OXYCODONE WITH NALOXONE">OXYCODONE WITH NALOXONE</a></li><li id="_6635"><a href="6635.htm" title="PAPAVERETUM">PAPAVERETUM</a></li><li id="_3540"><a href="3540.htm" title="PENTAZOCINE">PENTAZOCINE</a></li><li id="_3542"><a href="3542.htm" title="PETHIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE">PETHIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE</a></li><li id="_214542"><a href="214542.htm" title="TAPENTADOL">TAPENTADOL</a></li><li id="_17872"><a href="17872.htm" title="TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE">TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE</a></li></ul></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="3489.htm">Previous: NEFOPAM HYDROCHLORIDE</a> | <a class="top" href="3491.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="3512.htm">Next: BUPRENORPHINE</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="35091.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain 2012.
