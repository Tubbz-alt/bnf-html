comparable to that of <span>paracetamol</span> (<a title=" Non-opioid analgesics" href="3457.htm#_3457">section 4.7.1</a>), but <span>paracetamol</span> is preferred,
particularly in the elderly (see also <a title="target-block: nsaids elderly" href="29492.htm#_120005">Prescribing for the Elderly</a>).</p><p>In regular <i>full dosage</i> NSAIDs have both a lasting
analgesic and an anti-inflammatory effect which makes them particularly
useful for the treatment of continuous or regular pain associated
with inflammation. Therefore, although <span>paracetamol</span> often gives adequate pain control in osteoarthritis, NSAIDs are more appropriate than <span>paracetamol</span> or the opioid <span>analgesics</span> in the <i>inflammatory
arthritides </i>(e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) and in some cases
of <i>advanced osteoarthritis</i>. NSAIDs can also be of
benefit in the less well defined conditions of <i>back pain</i> and <i>soft-tissue
disorders</i>.</p><div class="cAZ" id="_5183.4"><h2>Choice</h2> <p class="cAX">Differences in anti-inflammatory activity
between NSAIDs are small, but there is considerable variation in individual
response and tolerance to these drugs. About 60% of patients will
respond to any NSAID; of the others, those who do not respond to one
may well respond to another. Pain relief starts soon after taking
the first dose and a full analgesic effect should normally be obtained
within a week, whereas an anti-inflammatory effect may not be achieved
(or may not be clinically assessable) for up to 3 weeks. If appropriate
responses are not obtained within these times, another NSAID should
be tried. </p><p>NSAIDs reduce the production of prostaglandins by inhibiting
the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase. They vary in their selectivity for inhibiting
different types of cyclo-oxygenase; selective inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2
is associated with less gastro-intestinal intolerance. Several other
factors also influence susceptibility to gastro-intestinal effects,
and a NSAID should be chosen on the basis of the incidence of gastro-intestinal
and other side-effects.</p><p><b><span>Ibuprofen</span></b> is a propionic acid derivative with
anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. It has fewer
side-effects than other non-selective NSAIDs but its anti-inflammatory
properties are weaker. Doses of 1.6 to 2.4 g daily are needed for
rheumatoid arthritis and it is unsuitable for conditions where inflammation
is prominent, such as acute gout. <b><span>Dexibuprofen</span></b> is the active enantiomer
of ibuprofen. It has similar properties to ibuprofen and is licensed
for the relief of mild to moderate pain and inflammation.</p><p>Other propionic acid derivatives:</p><p><b><span>Naproxen</span></b> is one of the first choices because it
combines good efficacy with a low incidence of side-effects (but more
than <span>ibuprofen</span>, see <a title="BNF:target-block: CSM advice GI sside effects" href="5183.htm#_5183.6">NSAIDs and Gastro-intestinal
Events</a>, below).</p><p><b><span>Fenoprofen</span></b> is as effective as <span>naproxen</span>, and <b><span>flurbiprofen</span></b> may be slightly more effective. Both are associated with slightly
more gastro-intestinal side-effects than <span>ibuprofen</span>.</p><p><b><span>Ketoprofen</span></b> has anti-inflammatory
properties similar to <span>ibuprofen</span> and has more side-effects
(see also <a title="BNF:target-block: CSM advice GI sside effects" href="5183.htm#_5183.6">NSAIDs and Gastro-intestinal
Events</a>, below). <b><span>Dexketoprofen</span></b>, an isomer of <span>ketoprofen</span>, has been introduced for the short-term relief
of mild to moderate pain.</p><p><b><span>Tiaprofenic acid</span></b> is as effective as <span>naproxen</span>; it has more side-effects than <span>ibuprofen</span> (<b>important:</b> reports of severe cystitis, see CSM
advice under <span><a title="target-block: tiaproenic csm advice" href="5262.htm#_120007">Tiaprofenic acid</a></span>).</p><p>Drugs with properties similar to those of propionic acid derivatives:</p><p><b>Diclofenac</b> and <b><span>aceclofenac</span></b> are similar in efficacy
to <span>naproxen</span>.</p><p><b><span>Etodolac</span></b> is comparable in efficacy to naproxen;
it is licensed for symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid
arthritis.</p><p><b><span>Indometacin</span></b> has an action equal
to or superior to that of <span>naproxen</span>, but with a
high incidence of side-effects including headache, dizziness, and
gastro-intestinal disturbances (see also <a title="BNF:target-block: CSM advice GI sside effects" href="5183.htm#_5183.6">NSAIDs and Gastro-intestinal
Events</a>, below).</p><p><span id="_5183.19"><span><b>Mefenamic acid</b></span> has minor anti-inflammatory
properties. It has occasionally been associated with diarrhoea and
haemolytic anaemia which require discontinuation of treatment.</span></p><p><b><span>Meloxicam</span></b> is licensed for the short-term relief
of pain in osteoarthritis and for long-term treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.</p><p><b><span>Nabumetone</span></b> is comparable in effect to <span>naproxen</span>.</p><p><b><span>Phenylbutazone</span></b> is licensed for ankylosing spondylitis,
but is not recommended because it is associated with serious side-effects,
in particular haematological reactions; it should be used only by
a specialist in severe cases where other treatments have been found
unsuitable.</p><p><b><span>Piroxicam</span></b> is as effective as <span>naproxen</span> and has a long duration of action which permits once-daily administration.
However, it has more gastro-intestinal side-effects than most other
NSAIDs, and is associated with more frequent serious skin reactions
(<b>important:</b> see <a title="target-block: Piroxicam CHMP advice" href="5255.htm#_5255.1">CHMP advice</a>).</p><p><b><span>Sulindac</span></b> is similar in tolerance to <span>naproxen</span>.</p><p><b><span>Tenoxicam</span></b> is similar in activity and tolerance
to <span>naproxen</span>. Its long duration of action allows
once-daily administration.</p><p><b><span>Tolfenamic acid</span></b> is licensed for the treatment
of migraine (<a title=" Treatment of the acute migraine attack" href="3550.htm#_3550">section 4.7.4.1</a>).</p><p><b>Ketorolac</b> and the selective inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase-2, <b><span>parecoxib</span></b>, are licensed for the short-term
management of postoperative pain (<a title=" Non-opioid analgesics" href="6618.htm#_6618">section 15.1.4.2</a>).</p><p>The selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase-2, <b><span>etoricoxib</span></b> and <b><span>celecoxib</span></b>, are as effective as non-selective
NSAIDs such as diclofenac and naproxen. Although selective inhibitors
can cause serious gastro-intestinal events, available evidence appears
to indicate that the risk of serious upper gastro-intestinal events
is lower with selective inhibitors compared to non-selective NSAIDs;
this advantage may be lost in patients who require concomitant low-dose
aspirin.</p><p><b>Celecoxib</b> and <b>etoricoxib</b> are

cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors) are contra-indicated in patients
with active gastro-intestinal ulceration or bleeding. Piroxicam, ketoprofen,
and ketorolac are contra-indicated in patients with any history of
gastro-intestinal bleeding, ulceration, or perforation. Other non-selective
NSAIDs are contra-indicated in patients with a history of recurrent gastro-intestinal
ulceration or haemorrhage (two or more distinct episodes), and in
patients with a history of gastro-intestinal bleeding or perforation
related to previous NSAID therapy (see also <a title="target-block: CSM advice GI sside effects" href="5183.htm#_5183.6">NSAIDS and Gastro-intestinal Events</a>). While it is preferable
to avoid NSAIDs in patients with active or previous gastro-intestinal
ulceration or bleeding, and to withdraw them if gastro-intestinal
lesions develop, nevertheless patients with serious rheumatic diseases (e.g.
rheumatoid arthritis) are usually dependent on NSAIDs for effective
relief of pain and stiffness. Patients at risk of gastro-intestinal
ulceration (including the elderly), who need NSAID treatment should
receive gastroprotective treatment; for advice on the prophylaxis
and treatment of NSAID-associated gastro-intestinal ulcers, see <a title=" Ulcer-healing drugs" href="2015.htm#_2015">section 1.3</a>. NSAIDs should also be used with caution in Crohn’s
disease or ulcerative colitis, as these conditions may be exacerbated.</p></div><p>For <b>interactions</b> of NSAIDs,

possibly leading to renal failure; deterioration in renal function
has also been reported after topical use; see also individual drugs.</p></div></div><div id="_204080"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Pregnancy</h2> <p class="cAX">Most manufacturers advise avoiding the
use of NSAIDs during pregnancy or avoiding them unless the potential
benefit outweighs the risk. NSAIDs should be avoided during the third
trimester because use is associated with a risk of closure of fetal
ductus arteriosus <i>in utero</i> and possibly persistent
pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. In addition, the onset of labour
may be delayed and its duration may be increased. See also individual
monographs for <a title="BNF:monograph: CELECOXIB" href="86687.htm#_86687">celecoxib</a> and <a title="BNF:monograph: ETORICOXIB" href="106541.htm#_106541">etoricoxib</a>.</p></div></div><div id="_204081"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Breast-feeding</h2> <p class="cAX">NSAIDs should be used with caution

as well as local effects of NSAIDs contribute to gastro-intestinal
damage; taking oral formulations with milk or food, or using enteric-coated
formulations, or changing the route of administration may only partially
reduce symptoms such as dyspepsia.</p><div class="cN"><h3 class="cBP">NSAIDs and gastro-intestinal events</h3><p>All NSAIDs are associated with serious gastro-intestinal toxicity;
the risk is higher in the elderly. Evidence on the relative safety
of non-selective NSAIDs indicates differences in the risks of serious
upper gastro-intestinal side-effects—piroxicam (see also <a title="BNF:target-block: Piroxicam CHMP advice" href="5255.htm#_5255.1">CHMP advice</a>), ketoprofen, and ketorolac
are associated with the highest risk; indometacin, diclofenac, and
naproxen are associated with intermediate risk, and ibuprofen with
the lowest risk (although high doses of ibuprofen have been associated
with intermediate risk). <b>Selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase-2</b> are associated with a <i>lower risk</i> of serious upper
gastro-intestinal side-effects than non-selective NSAIDs.<br /></p><p>Recommendations are that NSAIDs associated with a low risk e.g.
ibuprofen are <i>generally preferred</i>, to start at the <i>lowest recommended dose</i> and not to use more than one oral
NSAID at a time. See also <a title="BNF:target-block: NSAIDS and peptic ulcer disease" href="5183.htm#_5183.15">Cautions and Contra-indications</a>.<br /></p><p>The combination of a NSAID and low-dose aspirin can increase
the risk of gastro-intestinal side-effects; this combination should
be used only if absolutely necessary and the patient should be monitored
closely.</p></div><p>Other side-effects include hypersensitivity reactions
(particularly rashes, angioedema, and bronchospasm—see below), headache,
dizziness, nervousness, depression, drowsiness, insomnia, vertigo,
hearing disturbances such as tinnitus, photosensitivity, and haematuria.
Blood disorders have also occurred. Fluid retention may occur (rarely
precipitating congestive heart failure); blood pressure may be raised. </p><div id="_120012"><div class="cN"><h3 class="cBP">Asthma</h3><p>Any degree of worsening of asthma may be related to the ingestion
of NSAIDs, either prescribed or (in the case of <span>ibuprofen</span> and others) purchased over the counter.</p></div></div><p><span id="_5183.16">Renal failure may be provoked by NSAIDs,
especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment (<b>important</b>, see <a title="BNF:target-block: renal impairment NSAIDs" href="5183.htm#_204078">Renal impairment</a>,

with NSAIDs can lead to renal failure.</span> </p><p>Hepatic damage, alveolitis, pulmonary eosinophilia, pancreatitis,
visual disturbances, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal
necrolysis are other rare side-effects. Induction of or exacerbation
