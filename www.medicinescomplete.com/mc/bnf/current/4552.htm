oral contraceptives’) are effective preparations for general use.
Advantages of combined oral contraceptives include:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">reliable and reversible;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">reduced dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">reduced incidence of premenstrual tension;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">less symptomatic fibroids and functional ovarian cysts;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">less benign breast disease;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">reduced risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">reduced risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.</p></li></ul><p><span>Combined oral contraceptives</span> containing a
fixed amount of an oestrogen and a progestogen in each active tablet
are termed ‘monophasic’; those with varying amounts of the two hormones
are termed ‘phasic’. A transdermal patch and a vaginal ring, both
containing an oestrogen with a progestogen, are also available.</p><div class="cAZ"><h2>Choice</h2> <p class="cAX">The majority of combined oral contraceptives
contain ethinylestradiol as the oestrogen component; mestranol and
estradiol valerate are also used. The ethinylestradiol content of
combined oral contraceptives ranges from 20 to 40 micrograms. Generally
a preparation with the lowest oestrogen and progestogen content which
gives good cycle control and minimal side-effects in the individual
woman is chosen.</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ"><i>Low strength preparations</i> (containing <span>ethinylestradiol</span> 20 micrograms) are particularly appropriate
for women with risk factors for circulatory disease, provided a combined
oral contraceptive is otherwise suitable. It is recommended that the
combined oral contraceptive is not continued beyond 50 years of age
since more suitable alternatives exist.</p></li><li><p class="cQ"><i>Standard strength preparations</i> (containing <span>ethinylestradiol</span> 30 or 35 micrograms or in 30–40 microgram <i>phased</i> preparations) are appropriate for standard use—but
see Risk of Venous Thromboembolism below. Phased preparations are
generally reserved for women who <i>either</i> do not have
withdrawal bleeding <i>or</i> who have breakthrough bleeding
with monophasic products.</p></li></ul><p>The progestogens <span>desogestrel</span>, <span>drospirenone</span>, and <span>gestodene</span> (in combination with <span>ethinylestradiol</span>) may be considered for women who have
side-effects (such as acne, headache, depression, breast symptoms,
and breakthrough bleeding) with other progestogens. However, women
should be advised that desogestrel and gestodene
have also been associated with an increased risk of <i>venous
thromboembolism</i>. Drospirenone, a derivative of spironolactone,
has anti-androgenic and anti-mineralocorticoid activity; it should be used with care if an increased plasma-potassium concentration
might be hazardous.</p><p>The progestogen <span>norelgestromin</span> is combined
with <span>ethinylestradiol</span> in a transdermal patch (<span class="cZ">Evra</span>®).</p><p>The vaginal contraceptive ring contains the progestogen etonogestrel
combined with ethinylestradiol (<span class="cZ">NuvaRing</span>®).</p></div><div id="_4552.5"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Risk of venous thromboembolism</h2> <p class="cAX">There is an increased
risk of venous thromboembolic disease (particularly during the first
year) in users of oral contraceptives, but this risk is considerably
smaller than that associated with pregnancy (about 60 cases of venous
thromboembolic disease per 100 000 pregnancies). In all cases the
risk of venous thromboembolism increases with age and in the presence
of other risk factors for venous thromboembolism, such as obesity.</p><p>The incidence of venous thromboembolism in healthy, non-pregnant
women who are not taking an oral contraceptive is about 5–10 cases
per 100 000 women per year. For those using <span>combined oral
contraceptives</span> containing second-generation progestogens,
such as levonorgestrel, this incidence is about 20 per 100 000 women
per year of use. The risk of venous thromboembolism with transdermal
patches may be slightly increased compared with combined oral contraceptives
that contain levonorgestrel. Some studies have reported a greater
risk of venous thromboembolism in women using combined oral contraceptives
containing the third-generation progestogens desogestrel and gestodene;
the incidence in these women is about 40 per 100 000 women per year
of use. The absolute risk of venous thromboembolism in women using <span>combined oral contraceptives</span> containing these third-generation
progestogens is very small and well below the risk associated with
pregnancy. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using a combined
oral contraceptive containing drospirenone may be similar to that
associated with combined oral contraceptives containing third-generation
progestogens. The risk of venous thromboembolism associated with vaginal
ring use compared to the risk with other combined hormonal contraceptives
is unknown.</p><p>Provided that women are informed of the relative risks of venous
thromboembolism and accept them, the choice of oral contraceptive
is for the woman together with the prescriber jointly to make in light
of her individual medical history and any contra-indications.</p></div></div><div id="_4552.3"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Travel</h2> <p class="cAX">Women taking oral contraceptives or using the patch
or vaginal ring are at an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis during travel involving long periods of immobility (over 5 hours). The risk may be reduced by appropriate exercise during the journey
and possibly by wearing graduated compression hosiery.</p></div></div><div id="_4552.4"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Missed pill</h2> <p class="cAX">The critical time for loss of contraceptive
protection is when a pill is omitted at the <i>beginning</i> or <i>end</i> of a cycle (which lengthens the pill-free
interval).</p><p>If a woman forgets to take a pill, it should be taken as soon
as she remembers, and the next one taken at the normal time (even
if this means taking 2 pills together). A missed pill is one that
is 24 or more hours late; for women taking <i>Qlaira</i>®, see below. If a woman misses only one pill, she should take an
active pill as soon as she remembers and then resume normal pill-taking.
No additional precautions are necessary.</p><p>If a woman misses 2 or more pills (especially from the first
7 in a packet), she may not be protected. She should take an active
pill as soon as she remembers and then resume normal pill-taking.
In addition, she must either abstain from sex or use an additional
method of contraception such as a condom for the next 7 days. If these
7 days run beyond the end of the packet, the next packet should be
started at once, omitting the pill-free interval (or, in the case
of <i>everyday</i> (ED) pills, omitting the 7 inactive tablets).</p><p>A missed pill for a woman taking <i>Qlaira</i>® is
one that is 12 hours or more late; for information on how to manage
missed pills in women taking <span class="cZ">Qlaira</span>®, refer to
product literature.</p><p>Emergency contraception (<a title="sub-section: Emergency contraception" href="130054.htm#_130054">section 7.3.5</a>) is recommended if 2 or more
combined oral contraceptive tablets are missed from the first 7 tablets
in a packet and unprotected intercourse has occurred since finishing
the last packet.</p></div></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Delayed application or detached patch</h2> <p class="cAX">If a patch is partly detached for less than 24 hours, reapply to
the same site or replace with a new patch immediately; no additional
contraception is needed and the next patch should be applied on the
usual ‘change day’. If a patch remains detached for more than 24 hours
or if the user is not aware when the patch became detached, then stop
the current contraceptive cycle and start a new cycle by applying
a new patch, giving a new ‘Day 1’; an additional non-hormonal contraceptive
must be used concurrently for the first 7 days of the new cycle.</p><p>If application of a new patch at the start of a new cycle is
delayed, contraceptive protection is lost. A new patch should be applied
as soon as remembered giving a new ‘Day 1’; additional non-hormonal
methods of contraception should be used for the first 7 days of the
new cycle. If intercourse has occurred during this extended patch-free
interval, a possibility of fertilisation should be considered. If
application of a patch in the middle of the cycle is delayed (i.e.
the patch is not changed on day 8 or day 15):</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">for up to 48 hours, apply a new patch immediately; next
patch ‘change day’ remains the same and no additional contraception
is required;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">for more than 48 hours, contraceptive protection may have
been lost. Stop the current cycle and start a new 4-week cycle immediately
by applying a new patch giving a new ‘Day 1’; additional non-hormonal
contraception should be used for the first 7 days of the new cycle.</p></li></ul><p>If the patch is not removed at the end of the cycle (day 22),
remove it as soon as possible and start the next cycle on the usual
‘change day’, the day after day 28; no additional contraception is
required.</p></div><div id="_202426"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Expulsion, delayed insertion or removal, or broken vaginal
ring</h2> <p class="cAX">If the vaginal ring is expelled for <i>less
than 3 hours</i>, rinse the ring with cool water and reinsert
immediately; no additional contraception is needed.</p><p>If the ring remains outside the vagina for <i>more than
3 hours</i> or if the user does not know when the ring was expelled,
contraceptive protection may be reduced:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">If ring expelled during week 1 or 2 of cycle, rinse ring
with cool water and reinsert; use additional precautions (barrier
methods) for next 7 days;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">If ring expelled during week 3 of cycle, either insert
a new ring to start a new cycle <i>or</i> allow a withdrawal
bleed and insert a new ring no later than 7 days after ring was expelled;
latter option only available if ring was used continuously for at
least 7 days before expulsion.</p></li></ul><p>If insertion of a new ring at the start of a new cycle is delayed,
contraceptive protection is lost. A new ring should be inserted as
soon as possible; additional precautions (barrier methods) should
be used for the first 7 days of the new cycle. If intercourse occurred
during the extended ring-free interval, pregnancy should be considered.</p><p>No additional contraception is required if removal of the ring
is delayed by up to 1 week (4 weeks of continuous use). The 7-day
ring-free interval should be observed and subsequently a new ring
should be inserted. Contraceptive protection may be reduced with continuous
use of the ring for more than 4 weeks—pregnancy should be ruled out
before inserting a new ring.</p><p>If the ring breaks during use, remove it and insert a new ring
immediately; additional precautions (barrier methods) should be used
for the first 7 days of the new cycle.</p></div></div><div id="_4552.9"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Diarrhoea and vomiting</h2> <p class="cAX">Vomiting
and persistent, severe diarrhoea can interfere with the
absorption of combined oral contraceptives. If vomiting
occurs within 2 hours of taking a combined oral contraceptive another
pill should be taken as soon as possible. In cases of persistent vomiting
or severe diarrhoea lasting more than 24 hours, additional precautions
should be used during and for 7 days (9 days for <span class="cZ">Qlaira</span>®) after recovery (see also under <a title="target-block: Missed pill" href="4552.htm#_4552.4">Missed pill</a>). If the vomiting and diarrhoea occurs during the last 7 tablets,
the next pill-free interval should be omitted (in the case of ED tablets
the inactive ones should be omitted).</p></div></div><div id="_120026"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Interactions</h2> <p class="cAX">The effectiveness of <i>combined</i> oral contraceptives, <i>progestogen-only</i> oral contraceptives
(<a title="BNF:sub-sub-section: Oral progestogen-only contraceptives" href="4572.htm#_4572">section 7.3.2.1</a>), contraceptive
patches, and vaginal rings can be considerably reduced by interaction
with drugs that induce hepatic enzyme activity (e.g. <b><span>carbamazepine</span></b>, <b><span>eslicarbazepine</span></b>, <b><span>nelfinavir</span></b>, <b><span>nevirapine</span></b>, <b><span>oxcarbazepine</span></b>, <b><span>phenytoin</span></b>, <b><span>phenobarbital</span></b>, <b><span>primidone</span></b>, <b><span>ritonavir</span></b>, <b><span>St John’s Wort</span></b>, <b><span>topiramate</span></b>, and, above all, <b><span>rifabutin</span></b> and <b><span>rifampicin</span></b>). A condom together
with a long-acting method, such as an injectable contraceptive, may
be more suitable for patients with HIV infection or at risk of HIV
infection; advice on the possibility of interaction with antiretroviral
drugs should be sought from HIV specialists.</p><p>Women taking combined hormonal contraceptives who require enzyme-inducing
drugs should be advised to change to a contraceptive method that is
unaffected by enzyme-inducers (e.g. some parenteral progestogen-only
contraceptives (<a title="BNF:target-block: Parenteral progesterone only contraceptives interactions" href="4580.htm#_4580.4">section 7.3.2.2</a>),
intra-uterine devices) for the duration of treatment and for 4 weeks
after stopping. If a change in contraceptive method is undesirable
or inappropriate the following options should be discussed:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">For a <i>short course (2 months or less) of an enzyme-inducing
drug</i> (except rifampicin or rifabutin—see below), continue
with a combined oral contraceptive providing <span>ethinylestradiol</span> 30 micrograms or more daily and use a ‘tricycling’ regimen (i.e.
taking 3 packets of monophasic tablets without a break followed by
a shortened tablet-free interval of 4 days [unlicensed use]). Additional
contraceptive precautions should also be used whilst taking the enzyme-inducing
drug and for 4 weeks after stopping. Another option is to follow the
advice for long-term courses, below.</p><p class="cQ">For women using combined hormonal contraceptive patches or vaginal
rings, additional contraceptive precautions are also required whilst
taking the enzyme-inducing drug and for 4 weeks after stopping. If
concomitant administration runs beyond the 3 weeks of patch or vaginal
ring use, a new treatment cycle should be started immediately, without
a patch-free or ring-free break.</p></li><li><p class="cQ">For a <i>long-term course (over 2 months) of an enzyme-inducing
drug</i> (except rifampicin or rifabutin—see below), adjust the
dose of combined oral contraceptive to provide ethinylestradiol 50 micrograms
or more daily [unlicensed use] and use a ‘tricycling’ regimen (as
above); continue for the duration of treatment with the enzyme-inducing
drug and for 4 weeks after stopping. </p><p class="cQ">If breakthrough bleeding occurs (and all other causes are ruled
out) it is recommended that the dose of ethinylestradiol is increased
by increments of 10 micrograms up to a maximum of 70 micrograms daily
[unlicensed use], or to use additional precautions, or to change to
a method unaffected by enzyme-inducing drugs.</p><p class="cQ">Contraceptive patches and vaginal rings are not recommended
for women taking enzyme-inducing drugs over a long period.</p></li><li><p class="cQ"><span id="_4552.7">For any course of <b><span>rifampicin</span></b> or <b><span>rifabutin</span></b>, an alternative method of contraception (such as an IUD)
is <b>always</b> recommended because they are such potent
enzyme-inducing drugs. Since enzyme activity does not return to normal
for several weeks after stopping an enzyme-inducing drug, appropriate
contraceptive measures are required for 4 to 8 weeks after stopping.</span></p></li></ul><p>For information on interactions of oral progestogen-only contraceptives,

precautions are required when <i>combined</i> oral contraceptives
are used with antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes, unless
diarrhoea or vomiting occur (<a title="BNF:target-block: COC diarrhoea and vomiting" href="4552.htm#_4552.9">see above</a>). These
recommendations should be discussed with the woman, who should also
be advised that guidance in patient information leaflets may differ. </p><p>It is also currently recommended that no additional contraceptive
precautions are required when contraceptive patches or vaginal rings
are used with antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes. There
have been concerns that some antibacterials that do not induce liver
enzymes (e.g. ampicillin, doxycycline) reduce the efficacy of <i>combined</i> oral contraceptives by impairing the bacterial
flora responsible for recycling ethinylestradiol from the large bowel.
However, there is a lack of evidence to support this interaction. </p></div></div></div><div id="_4552.6"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Surgery</h2> <p class="cAX">Oestrogen-containing contraceptives should
preferably be discontinued (and adequate alternative contraceptive
arrangements made) 4 weeks before major elective surgery and all surgery
to the legs or surgery which involves prolonged immobilisation of
a lower limb; they should normally be recommenced at the first menses
occurring at least 2 weeks after full mobilisation. A progestogen-only
contraceptive may be offered as an alternative and the oestrogen-containing
contraceptive restarted after mobilisation, as above. When discontinuation
of an oestrogen-containing contraceptive is not possible, e.g. after
trauma or if a patient admitted for an elective procedure is still
on an oestrogen-containing contraceptive, thromboprophylaxis (with
unfractionated or low molecular weight <span>heparin</span> and
graduated compression hosiery) is advised. These recommendations do
not apply to minor surgery with short duration of anaesthesia, e.g.
laparoscopic sterilisation or tooth extraction, or to women using
oestrogen-free hormonal contraceptives.</p></div></div><div id="_120027"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Reason to stop immediately</h2> <p class="cAX">Combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
should be stopped (pending investigation and treatment), if any of
the following occur:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">sudden severe chest pain (even if not radiating to left
