Use of acarbose is usually reserved for when other oral hypoglycaemics are not tolerated or are contra-indicated. Postprandial hyperglycaemia in type 1 diabetes can be reduced by acarbose, but it has been little used for this purpose. Flatulence deters some from using acarbose although this side-effect tends to decrease with time.</p><p><strong>Nateglinide</strong> and <strong>repaglinide</strong> stimulate insulin secretion. Both drugs have a rapid onset of action and short duration of activity, and should be administered shortly before each main meal. Repaglinide may be given as monotherapy for patients who are not overweight or for those in whom metformin is contra-indicated or not tolerated, or it may be given in combination with metformin. Nateglinide is licensed only for use with metformin.</p><p>The thiazolidinedione, <strong>pioglitazone</strong>, reduces peripheral insulin resistance, leading to a reduction of blood-glucose concentration. Pioglitazone can be used alone or in combination with metformin or with a sulfonylurea (if metformin inappropriate), or with both; the combination of pioglitazone plus metformin is preferred to pioglitazone plus sulfonylurea, particularly for obese patients. Inadequate response to a combination of metformin and sulfonylurea may indicate failing insulin release; the introduction of pioglitazone has a limited role in these circumstances and the initiation of insulin is often more appropriate. Pioglitazone is also licensed in combination with insulin, in patients who have not achieved adequate glycaemic control with insulin alone, when metformin is inappropriate. Blood-glucose control may deteriorate temporarily when pioglitazone is substituted for an oral antidiabetic drug that is being used in combination with another. Long-term benefits of pioglitazone have not yet been demonstrated. NICE (May 2009) has recommended that, when glycaemic control is inadequate with existing treatment, pioglitazone can be added to: </p><ul><li><p>a sulfonylurea, if metformin is contra-indicated or not tolerated;</p> </li><li><p>metformin, if risks of hypoglycaemia with sulfonylurea are unacceptable or a sulfonylurea is contra-indicated or not tolerated;</p> </li><li><p>a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea, if insulin is unacceptable because of lifestyle or other personal issues, or because the patient is obese.</p> </li></ul><p>NICE has recommended that treatment with pioglitazone is continued only if HbA<sub>1c</sub> concentration is reduced by at least 0.5 percentage points within 6 months of starting treatment.</p><p>The <a title="BNF:target-block: NICE and Scottish Medicines Consortium" href="PHP60-general-guidance.htm#PHP70"><em>Scottish Medicines Consortium</em></a> accepts use of pioglitazone (February 2007) with metformin and a sulfonylurea, for patients (especially if overweight) whose glycaemic control is inadequate despite the use of 2 oral hypoglycaemic drugs and who are unable or unwilling to take insulin; treatment should be initiated and monitored by an experienced diabetes physician.</p><div id="PHP4174" class="cI"><p class="cAE">MHRA/CHM advice</p><h3 class="cT">Pioglitazone cardiovascular safety (December 2007 and January 2011)</h3><p>Incidence of heart failure is increased when pioglitazone is combined with insulin especially in patients with predisposing factors e.g. previous myocardial infarction.

However, in patients who respond adequately to treatment, the benefits of pioglitazone continue to outweigh the risks.</p><p>Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer or a past history of bladder cancer, or in those who have uninvestigated macroscopic haematuria. Pioglitazone should be used with caution in elderly patients as the risk of bladder cancer increases with age.</p><p>Before initiating treatment with pioglitazone, patients should be assessed for risk factors of bladder cancer (including age, smoking status, exposure to certain occupational or chemotherapy agents, or previous radiation therapy to the pelvic region) and any macroscopic haematuria should be investigated. The safety and efficacy of pioglitazone should be reviewed after 3–6 months and pioglitazone should be stopped in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment.</p><p>Patients already receiving treatment with pioglitazone should be assessed for risk factors of bladder cancer and treatment should be reviewed after 3–6 months, as above.</p><p>Patients should be advised to report promptly any haematuria, dysuria, or urinary urgency during treatment.</p></div><div class="cI"><h3 class="cT">Rosiglitazone</h3><p>The marketing authorisation for rosiglitazone (<em>Avandia</em>®, <em>Avandamet</em>®) has been suspended (September 2010) following a review by the European Medicines Agency. The European Medicines Agency concluded that the benefits of rosiglitazone treatment do not outweigh the cardiovascular risks. Prescribers should not issue new or repeat prescriptions for rosiglitazone. Treatment of patients who are taking rosiglitazone should be reviewed.</p></div><p><strong>Linagliptin</strong>, <strong>saxagliptin</strong>, <strong>sitagliptin</strong>, and <strong>vildagliptin</strong> inhibit dipeptidylpeptidase-4 to increase insulin secretion and lower glucagon secretion. Linagliptin is licensed for use in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy (if metformin inappropriate), or in combination with metformin (when treatment with metformin alone fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control), or both metformin and a sulfonylurea (when dual therapy with these drugs fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control). Saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin are licensed for use in type 2 diabetes in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea (if metformin inappropriate) or pioglitazone, when treatment with either metformin or a sulfonylurea or pioglitazone fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control. Sitagliptin and vildagliptin are also licensed for use as monotherapy (if metformin inappropriate) and in combination with both metformin and a sulfonylurea when dual therapy with these drugs fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control. Sitagliptin is also licensed for use in combination with both metformin and pioglitazone when dual therapy with these drugs fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control.
