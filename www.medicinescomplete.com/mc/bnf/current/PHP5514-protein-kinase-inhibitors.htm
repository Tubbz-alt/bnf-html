If adverse reactions are not managed with dose delays, a dose reduction should be considered—consult product literature.</p><p id="PHP18391"><strong>Vandetanib</strong>, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is licensed for the treatment of aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.</p><p id="PHP18364"><strong>Vemurafenib</strong>, a BRAF kinase inhibitor, is licensed as a monotherapy for the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.</p></div><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li id="_PHP5527-dasatinib"><a href="PHP5527-dasatinib.htm" title="DASATINIB">DASATINIB</a></li><li id="_PHP5529-erlotinib"><a href="PHP5529-erlotinib.htm" title="ERLOTINIB">ERLOTINIB</a></li><li id="_PHP5531-everolimus"><a href="PHP5531-everolimus.htm" title="EVEROLIMUS">EVEROLIMUS</a></li><li id="_PHP5534-gefitinib"><a href="PHP5534-gefitinib.htm" title="GEFITINIB">GEFITINIB</a></li><li id="_PHP5536-imatinib"><a href="PHP5536-imatinib.htm" title="IMATINIB">IMATINIB</a></li><li id="_PHP5538-lapatinib"><a href="PHP5538-lapatinib.htm" title="LAPATINIB">LAPATINIB</a></li><li id="_PHP5540-nilotinib"><a href="PHP5540-nilotinib.htm" title="NILOTINIB">NILOTINIB</a></li><li id="_PHP5542-pazopanib"><a href="PHP5542-pazopanib.htm" title="PAZOPANIB">PAZOPANIB</a></li><li id="_PHP5544-sorafenib"><a href="PHP5544-sorafenib.htm" title="SORAFENIB">SORAFENIB</a></li><li id="_PHP5546-sunitinib"><a href="PHP5546-sunitinib.htm" title="SUNITINIB">SUNITINIB</a></li><li id="_PHP5548-temsirolimus"><a href="PHP5548-temsirolimus.htm" title="TEMSIROLIMUS">TEMSIROLIMUS</a></li><li id="_PHP18390-vandetanib"><a href="PHP18390-vandetanib.htm" title="VANDETANIB">VANDETANIB</a></li><li id="_PHP17983-vemurafenib"><a href="PHP17983-vemurafenib.htm" title="VEMURAFENIB">VEMURAFENIB</a></li></ul></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="PHP5511-procarbazine.htm">Previous: PROCARBAZINE</a> | <a class="top" href="PHP5514-protein-kinase-inhibitors.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="PHP5527-dasatinib.htm">Next: DASATINIB</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Cookie and Privacy Policy">Cookie and Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="PHP0-publication-information.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and Pharmaceutical Press 2012.
