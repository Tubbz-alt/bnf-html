carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. It is a polypeptide hormone
of complex structure. There are differences in the amino-acid sequence
of animal insulins, human insulins and the human insulin analogues.
Insulin may be extracted from pork pancreas and purified by crystallisation;
it may also be extracted from beef pancreas, but beef insulins are
now rarely used. Human sequence insulin may be produced semisynthetically by enzymatic
modification of porcine insulin (emp) or biosynthetically by recombinant
DNA technology using bacteria (crb, prb) or yeast (pyr).</p><p>All insulin preparations are to a greater or lesser extent immunogenic
in man but immunological resistance to insulin action is uncommon.
Preparations of human sequence insulin should theoretically be less
immunogenic, but no real advantage has been shown in trials.</p><p>Insulin is inactivated by gastro-intestinal enzymes, and must
therefore be given by injection; the subcutaneous route is ideal in
most circumstances. Insulin is usually injected into the upper arms,
thighs, buttocks, or abdomen; absorption from a limb site may be increased
if the limb is used in strenuous exercise after the injection. Generally
subcutaneous insulin injections cause few problems; lipodystrophy
may occur but can be minimised by using different injection sites
in rotation. Local allergic reactions are rare.</p><p>Insulin is needed by all patients with ketoacidosis, and it
is likely to be needed by most patients with:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">rapid onset of symptoms;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">substantial loss of weight;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">weakness;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">ketonuria;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">a first-degree relative who has type 1 diabetes.</p></li></ul><p>Insulin is required by almost all children with diabetes. It
is also needed for type 2 diabetes when other methods have failed
to achieve good control, and temporarily in the presence of intercurrent
illness or peri-operatively. Pregnant women with type 2 diabetes may
be treated with insulin when diet alone fails. For advice on use of
oral antidiabetic drugs in the management of diabetes in pregnancy,
see <a title="BNF:target-block: Antidiabetic drugs and pregnancy and breast-feeding" href="4163.htm#_201715">section 6.1.2</a>.</p><div class="cN"><h2 class="cBQ">NHS Diabetes guidance</h2><h3 class="cBP">Safe and Effective Use of Insulin in Hospitalised
Patients (March 2010)</h3><p>Available at <a href="http://www.diabetes.nhs.uk" title="external link">www.diabetes.nhs.uk</a></p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Management of diabetes with insulin</h2> <p class="cAX">The aim of
treatment is to achieve the best possible control of blood-glucose
concentration without making the patient obsessional and to avoid
disabling hypoglycaemia; close co-operation is needed between the
patient and the medical team because good control reduces the risk
of complications.</p></div><p>Insulin preparations can be divided into 3 types:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">those of <b>short</b> duration which have a
relatively rapid onset of action, namely soluble insulin and the rapid-acting
insulin analogues, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine, and insulin
lispro (<a title="BNF:sub-sub-section: Short-acting insulins" href="4082.htm#_4082">section 6.1.1.1</a>);</p></li><li><p class="cQ">those with an <b>intermediate</b> action, e.g.
isophane insulin (<a title="BNF:sub-sub-section: Intermediate- and long-acting insulins" href="4093.htm#_4093">section 6.1.1.2</a>); and</p></li><li><p class="cQ">those whose action is slower in onset and lasts for <b>long</b> periods, e.g. protamine zinc insulin, insulin detemir,
and insulin glargine (<a title="BNF:sub-sub-section: Intermediate- and long-acting insulins" href="4093.htm#_4093">section 6.1.1.2</a>).</p></li></ul><p>The duration of action of a particular type of insulin varies
considerably from one patient to another, and needs to be assessed
individually.</p><p>Mixtures of insulin preparations may be required and appropriate
combinations have to be determined for the individual patient. Treatment
should be started with a short-acting insulin (e.g. soluble insulin)
or a rapid-acting insulin analogue (e.g. insulin aspart) given before
meals with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin once or twice
daily. Alternatively, for those who have difficulty with, or prefer
not to use, multiple injection regimens, a mixture of premixed short-acting
insulin or rapid acting insulin analogue with an intermediate-acting
or long-acting insulin (most commonly in a proportion of 30% soluble
insulin and 70% isophane insulin) can be given once or twice daily.
The dose of short-acting or rapid-acting insulin (or the proportion
of the short-acting soluble insulin component in premixed insulin)
can be increased in those with excessive postprandial hyperglycaemia.
The dose of insulin is increased gradually according to the patient’s
individual requirements, taking care to avoid troublesome hypoglycaemic
reactions.</p><div id="_4081.1"><p>Insulin requirements may be increased by infection, stress, accidental or surgical trauma, and during
puberty. Requirements may be decreased in those with certain endocrine
disorders (e.g. Addison’s disease, hypopituitarism), or in coeliac
disease.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Examples of recommended insulin regimens</h2><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">Multiple injection regimen: short-acting insulin or rapid-acting
insulin analogue, before meals <br />With intermediate-acting
or long-acting insulin, once or twice daily;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">Short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue
mixed with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin, once or twice
daily (before meals);</p></li><li><p class="cQ">Intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin, once or twice
daily<br />With or without short-acting insulin or rapid-acting
insulin before meals;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (see below).</p></li></ul></div><div id="_204111"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Hepatic impairment</h2> <p class="cAX">Insulin requirements may be
decreased in patients with hepatic impairment.</p></div></div><div id="_204112"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Renal impairment</h2> <p class="cAX">Insulin requirements may decrease
in patients with renal impairment and therefore dose reduction may
be necessary. The compensatory response to hypoglycaemia is impaired
in renal impairment.</p></div></div><div id="_201556"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</h2> <p class="cAX">During pregnancy
and breast-feeding, insulin requirements may alter and doses should
be assessed frequently by an experienced diabetes physician. The dose
of insulin generally needs to be increased in the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy. The short-acting insulin analogues, insulin
aspart and insulin lispro, are not known to be harmful, and may be
used during pregnancy and lactation. The safety of long-acting insulin
analogues in pregnancy has not been established, therefore isophane
insulin is recommended where longer-acting insulins are needed.</p></div></div><div id="_4081.7"><div class="cAZ" id="_213759"><h2>Insulin administration</h2> <p class="cAX">Insulin is generally given
by <i>subcutaneous injection</i>; the injection site should
be rotated to prevent lipodystrophy. Injection devices (‘pens’) (<a title=" Hypodermic equipment" href="4141.htm#_4141">section 6.1.1.3</a>), which hold the insulin in a cartridge and
meter the required dose, are convenient to use. Insulin syringes (for
use with needles) are required for insulins not available in cartridge
form.</p><p>For intensive insulin regimens multiple subcutaneous injections
(3 or more times daily) are usually recommended.</p><p>Short-acting injectable insulins (soluble insulin, insulin aspart,
insulin glulisine, and insulin lispro) can also be given by <i>continuous
subcutaneous infusion</i> using a portable infusion pump. This
device delivers a continuous basal insulin infusion and patient-activated
bolus doses at meal times. This technique can be useful for patients
who suffer recurrent hypoglycaemia or marked morning rise in blood-glucose
concentration despite optimised multiple-injection regimens (see also
NICE guidance, <a title="BNF:target-block: Nice guidance box subcut insulin" href="4081.htm#_213759">below</a>). Patients on
subcutaneous insulin infusion must be highly motivated, able to monitor
their blood-glucose concentration, and have expert training, advice
and supervision from an experienced healthcare team.</p><div class="cN"><h2 class="cBR">NICE guidance</h2><h3 class="cBP">Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for the
treatment of diabetes mellitus (type 1) (July 2008)</h3><p>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is recommended as an
option in adults and children over 12 years with type 1 diabetes:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">who suffer repeated or unpredictable hypoglycaemia, whilst
attempting to achieve optimal glycaemic control with multiple-injection
regimens, <b>or</b></p></li><li><p class="cQ">whose glycaemic control remains inadequate (HbA<sub>1c</sub> over 8.5% [69 mmol/mol]) despite optimised multiple-injection regimens
(including the use of long-acting insulin analogues where appropriate).</p></li></ul><p>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is also recommended
as an option for children under 12 years with type 1 diabetes for
whom multiple-injection regimens are considered impractical or inappropriate.
Children on insulin pumps should undergo a trial of multiple-injection
therapy between the ages of 12 and 18 years.</p></div><p>Soluble insulin by the <i>intravenous route</i> is reserved for urgent treatment, e.g. in diabetic ketoacidosis,
and for fine control in serious illness and in the peri-operative
period (see under Diabetes and Surgery, below).</p></div></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Units</h2> <p class="cAX">The word ‘unit’ should <b>not</b> be abbreviated.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Monitoring</h2> <p class="cAX">Many patients now monitor their own blood-glucose
concentrations (<a title=" Diagnostic and monitoring agents for diabetes mellitus" href="4202.htm#_4202">section 6.1.6</a>). Since
blood-glucose concentration varies substantially throughout the day,
‘normoglycaemia’ cannot always be achieved throughout a 24-hour period
without causing damaging hypoglycaemia. It is therefore best to recommend
that patients should maintain a blood-glucose concentration of between
4 and 9 mmol/litre for most of the time (4–7 mmol/litre before meals
and less than 9 mmol/litre after meals), while accepting that on occasions,
for brief periods, it will be above these values; strenuous efforts
should be made to prevent the blood-glucose concentration from falling
below 4 mmol/litre. Patients using multiple injection regimens should
understand how to adjust their insulin dose according to their carbohydrate
intake. With fixed-dose insulin regimens, the carbohydrate intake
needs to be regulated, and should be distributed throughout the day
to match the insulin regimen. The intake of energy and of simple and
complex carbohydrates should be adequate to allow normal growth and
development but obesity must be avoided.</p></div><div id="_4081.2"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Hypoglycaemia</h2> <p class="cAX">Hypoglycaemia is a potential problem with
insulin therapy. All patients must be carefully instructed on how
to avoid it.</p><p>Loss of warning of hypoglycaemia among insulin-treated
patients can be a serious hazard, especially for drivers
and those in dangerous occupations. Very tight control
of diabetes lowers the blood-glucose concentration needed to trigger
hypoglycaemic symptoms; an increase in
the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes may reduce the warning symptoms
experienced by the patient. Beta-blockers can also blunt
hypoglycaemic awareness (and also delay recovery).</p><p>To restore the warning signs, episodes of hypoglycaemia must
be minimised; this involves appropriate adjustment of insulin type,
dose and frequency together with suitable timing and quantity of meals
and snacks.</p><p>Some patients have reported loss of hypoglycaemia
warning after transfer to human insulin. Clinical studies
do not confirm that human insulin decreases hypoglycaemia awareness.
If a patient believes that human insulin is responsible for the loss
of warning it is reasonable to revert to animal insulin and essential
to educate the patient about avoiding hypoglycaemia. Great care should
be taken to specify whether a human or an animal preparation is required.</p><p>Few patients are now treated with beef insulins; when undertaking
conversion from beef to human insulin, the total dose should be reduced
by about 10% with careful monitoring for the first few days. When
changing between pork and human-sequence insulins, a dose change is
not usually needed, but careful monitoring is still advised.</p></div></div><div id="_204020"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Diabetes and surgery</h2> <p class="cAX">Perioperative control of blood-glucose concentrations
in patients with type 1 diabetes is achieved via an adjustable, continuous,
intravenous infusion of insulin. Detailed local protocols should be
available to all healthcare professionals involved in the treatment
of these patients; in general, the following steps should be followed:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">Give an injection of the patient’s usual insulin on the
night before the operation;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">Early on the day of the operation, start an intravenous
infusion of glucose containing <span>potassium chloride</span> (provided that the patient is not hyperkalaemic) and infuse at a
constant rate appropriate to the patient’s fluid requirements (usually
125 mL per hour); make up a solution of <span>soluble insulin</span> in <span>sodium chloride</span> 0.9% and infuse intravenously
using a syringe pump piggy-backed to the intravenous infusion. Glucose
and potassium infusions, and insulin infusions should be made up according
to locally agreed protocols;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">The rate of the insulin infusion should be adjusted according
to blood-glucose concentration (frequent monitoring necessary) in
line with locally agreed protocols. Other factors affecting the rate
of infusion include the patient’s volume depletion, cardiac function,
and age.</p></li></ul><p>Protocols should include specific instructions on how to manage
resistant cases (such as patients who are in shock or severely ill
or those receiving <span>corticosteroids</span> or sympathomimetics)
and those with hypoglycaemia.</p><p>If a syringe pump is not available, <span>soluble insulin</span> should be added to the intravenous infusion of <span>glucose</span> and <span>potassium chloride</span> (provided the patient
is not hyperkalaemic), and the infusion run at the rate appropriate
to the patient’s fluid requirements (usually 125 mL per hour) with
the insulin dose adjusted according to blood-glucose concentration
in line with locally agreed protocols.</p><p>Once the patient starts to eat and drink, give subcutaneous
insulin before breakfast and stop intravenous insulin 30 minutes later;
the dose may need to be 10–20% more than usual if the patient is still
in bed or unwell. If the patient was not previously receiving insulin,
an appropriate initial dose is 30–40 units daily in four divided doses
using <span>soluble insulin</span> before meals and intermediate-acting
insulin at bedtime and the dose adjusted from day to day. Patients with hyperglycaemia often relapse after
conversion back to subcutaneous insulin calling for one of the following
approaches:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">additional doses of <span>soluble insulin</span> at any of the four injection times (before meals or bedtime) <i>or</i></p></li><li><p class="cQ">temporary addition of intravenous insulin infusion (while
continuing the subcutaneous regimen) until blood-glucose concentration
is satisfactory <i>or</i></p></li><li><p class="cQ">complete reversion to the intravenous regimen (especially
if the patient is unwell).</p></li></ul></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Insulin Passport</h2><p>Insulin Passports and patient information booklets should be offered
to patients receiving insulin. The Insulin Passport provides a record
of the patient’s current insulin preparations and contains a section
for emergency information. The patient information booklet provides
advice on the safe use of insulin. They are available for purchase
