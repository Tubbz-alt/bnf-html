Antipsychotic drugs are used to alleviate severe anxiety but this too should be a short-term measure.</p> <div><h2>Schizophrenia</h2><p>The aim of treatment is to alleviate the suffering of the patient (and carer) and to improve social and cognitive functioning. Many patients require life-long treatment with antipsychotic medication. Antipsychotic drugs relieve positive psychotic symptoms such as thought disorder, hallucinations, and delusions, and prevent relapse; they are usually less effective on negative symptoms such as apathy and social withdrawal. In many patients, negative symptoms persist between episodes of treated positive symptoms, but earlier treatment of psychotic illness may protect against the development of negative symptoms over time. Patients with acute schizophrenia generally respond better than those with chronic symptoms.</p><p>Long-term treatment of a patient with a definitive diagnosis of schizophrenia is usually required after the first episode of illness in order to prevent relapses. Doses that are effective in acute episodes should generally be continued as prophylaxis.</p></div> <div><h2>First-generation antipsychotic drugs</h2><p>The first-generation antipsychotic drugs act predominantly by blocking dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the brain. First-generation antipsychotic drugs are not selective for any of the four dopamine pathways in the brain and so can cause a range of side-effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms and elevated prolactin. The <strong>phenothiazine</strong> derivatives can be divided into 3 main groups:</p><ul class="cW"><li><p><em>Group 1</em>: chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, and promazine, generally characterised by pronounced sedative effects and moderate antimuscarinic and extrapyramidal side-effects.</p> </li><li><p><em>Group 2</em>: pericyazine and pipotiazine, generally characterised by moderate sedative effects, but fewer extrapyramidal side-effects than groups 1 or 3.</p> </li><li><p><em>Group 3</em>: fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and trifluoperazine, generally characterised by fewer sedative and antimuscarinic effects, but more pronounced extrapyramidal side-effects than groups 1 and 2.</p> </li></ul><p><strong>Butyrophenones</strong> (benperidol and haloperidol) resemble the <em>group 3</em> phenothiazines in their clinical properties. <strong>Thioxanthenes</strong> (flupentixol and zuclopentixol) have moderate sedative, antimuscarinic effects, and extrapyramidal effects. <strong>Diphenylbutylpiperidines</strong> (pimozide) and the <strong>substituted benzamides</strong> (sulpiride) have reduced sedative, antimuscarinic, and extrapyramidal effects.</p></div> <div><h2>Second-generation antipsychotic drugs</h2><p>The second-generation antipsychotic drugs (sometimes referred to as atypical antipsychotic drugs) act on a range of receptors in comparison to first-generation antipsychotic drugs and have more distinct clinical profiles, particularly with regard to side-effects.</p><p><strong>Amisulpride</strong> is a selective dopamine receptor antagonist with high affinity for mesolimbic D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptors; <strong>clozapine</strong> is a dopamine D<sub>1</sub>, dopamine D<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor, and muscarinic-receptor antagonist; <strong>olanzapine</strong> is a dopamine D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>4</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, histamine-1-, and muscarinic-receptor antagonist; <strong>paliperidone</strong> is a metabolite of risperidone; <strong>quetiapine</strong> is a dopamine D<sub>1</sub>, dopamine D<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor, and histamine-1 receptor antagonist; and <strong>risperidone</strong> is a dopamine D<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor, and histamine-1 receptor antagonist.</p><p><strong>Aripiprazole</strong> is a dopamine D<sub>2</sub> partial agonist with weak 5-HT<sub>1a</sub> partial agonism and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonism. Aripiprazole can cause nausea and, unlike other antipsychotic drugs, lowers prolactin.</p></div> <div id="PHP2195"><h2>Cautions</h2><p>Antipsychotic drugs should be used with <strong>caution</strong> in patients with cardiovascular disease; an ECG may be required (see individual drug monographs), particularly if physical examination identifies cardiovascular risk factors, if there is a personal history of cardiovascular disease, or if the patient is being admitted as an inpatient. Antipsychotic drugs should also be used with caution in Parkinson's disease (may be exacerbated by antipsychotics), epilepsy (and conditions predisposing to seizures), depression, myasthenia gravis, prostatic hypertrophy, or a susceptibility to angle-closure glaucoma. Caution is also required in severe respiratory disease and in patients with a history of jaundice or who have blood dyscrasias (perform blood counts if unexplained infection or fever develops). As photosensitisation may occur with higher dosages, patients should avoid direct sunlight. Patients with schizophrenia should have physical health monitoring (including cardiovascular disease risk assessment) at least once per year. <strong>Interactions:</strong> Appendix 1 (antipsychotics). </p></div> <div id="PHP2198"><h2>Contra-indications</h2><p>Antipsychotic drugs may be <strong>contra-indicated</strong> in comatose states, CNS depression, and phaeochromocytoma. </p> </div> <div class="cI" id="PHP2199"><h3 class="cT">Prescribing for the elderly</h3><p>The balance of risks and benefit should be considered before prescribing antipsychotic drugs for elderly patients. In elderly patients with dementia, antipsychotic drugs are associated with a small increased risk of mortality and an increased risk of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Furthermore, elderly patients are particularly susceptible to postural hypotension and to hyper- and hypothermia in hot or cold weather.</p><p>It is recommended that:</p><ul><li><p>Antipsychotic drugs should not be used in elderly patients to treat mild to moderate psychotic symptoms.</p> </li><li><p>Initial doses of antipsychotic drugs in elderly patients should be reduced (to half the adult dose or less), taking into account factors such as the patient's weight, co-morbidity, and concomitant medication.</p> </li><li><p>Treatment should be reviewed regularly.</p> </li></ul></div> <div id="PHP2200"><h2>Driving</h2><p>Drowsiness may affect performance of skilled tasks (e.g. driving or operating machinery), especially at start of treatment; effects of alcohol are enhanced.</p></div> <div id="PHP2201"><h2>Withdrawal</h2><p>There is a high risk of relapse if medication is stopped after 1–2 years. Withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs after long-term therapy should always be gradual and closely monitored to avoid the risk of acute withdrawal syndromes or rapid relapse. Patients should be monitored for 2 years after withdrawal of antipsychotic medication for signs and symptoms of relapse.</p></div> <div id="PHP2202"><h2>Hepatic impairment</h2><p>All antipsychotic drugs can precipitate coma if used in hepatic impairment; phenothiazines are hepatotoxic. See also under individual drugs.</p></div> <div id="PHP2203"><h2>Renal impairment</h2><p>Start with small doses of antipsychotic drugs in severe renal impairment because of increased cerebral sensitivity. See also under individual drugs.</p></div> <div id="PHP2204"><h2>Pregnancy</h2><p>Extrapyramidal effects and withdrawal syndrome have been reported occasionally in the neonate when antipsychotic drugs are taken during the third trimester of pregnancy. Following maternal use of antipsychotic drugs in the third trimester, neonates should be monitored for symptoms including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, drowsiness, feeding problems, and respiratory distress. See also under individual drugs.</p></div> <div id="PHP2205"><h2>Breast-feeding</h2><p>There is limited information available on the short- and long-term effects of antipsychotic drugs on the breast-fed infant. <em>Animal</em> studies indicate possible adverse effects of antipsychotic medicines on the developing nervous system. Chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs whilst breast-feeding should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Phenothiazine derivatives are sometimes used in breast-feeding women for short-term treatment of nausea and vomiting. See also under individual drugs.</p></div> <div id="PHP2206"><h2>Side-effects</h2><p>Side-effects caused by antipsychotic drugs are common and contribute significantly to non-adherence to therapy.</p><p>Extrapyramidal symptoms occur most frequently with the piperazine phenothiazines (fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and trifluoperazine), the butyrophenones (benperidol and haloperidol), and the first-generation depot preparations. They are easy to recognise but cannot be predicted accurately because they depend on the dose, the type of drug, and on individual susceptibility.</p><p>Extrapyramidal symptoms consist of:</p><ul><li><p><em>parkinsonian symptoms</em> (including tremor), which may occur more commonly in adults or the elderly and may appear gradually;</p> </li><li><p><em>dystonia</em> (abnormal face and body movements) and <em>dyskinesia</em>, which occur more commonly in children or young adults and appear after only a few doses;</p> </li><li><p><em>akathisia</em> (restlessness), which characteristically occurs after large initial doses and may resemble an exacerbation of the condition being treated;</p> </li><li><p><em>tardive dyskinesia</em> (rhythmic, involuntary movements of tongue, face, and jaw), which usually develops on long-term therapy or with high dosage, but it may develop on short-term treatment with low doses—short-lived tardive dyskinesia may occur after withdrawal of the drug.</p> </li></ul><p><em>Parkinsonian symptoms</em> remit if the drug is withdrawn and may be suppressed by the administration of <strong>antimuscarinic</strong> drugs (<a title="BNF:sub-section: Antimuscarinic drugs used in parkinsonism" href="PHP3134-antimuscarinic-drugs-used-in-parkinsonism.htm">section 4.9.2</a>). However, routine administration of such drugs is not justified because not all patients are affected and they may unmask or worsen tardive dyskinesia.</p><p><em>Tardive dyskinesia</em> is the most serious manifestation of extrapyramidal symptoms; it is of particular concern because it may be irreversible on withdrawing therapy and treatment is usually ineffective. However, some manufacturers suggest that drug withdrawal at the earliest signs of tardive dyskinesia (fine vermicular movements of the tongue) may halt its full development. Tardive dyskinesia occurs fairly frequently, especially in the elderly, and treatment must be carefully and regularly reviewed.</p><p>Most antipsychotic drugs, both first- and second-generation, increase prolactin concentration to some extent because dopamine inhibits prolactin release. Aripiprazole reduces prolactin because it is a dopamine-receptor partial agonist. Risperidone, amisulpride, and first-generation antipsychotic drugs are most likely to cause symptomatic hyperprolactinaemia. The clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia include sexual dysfunction, reduced bone mineral density, menstrual disturbances, breast enlargement, and galactorrhoea. </p><p>Sexual dysfunction is one of the main causes of non-adherence to antipsychotic medication; physical illness, psychiatric illness, and substance misuse are contributing factors. Antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction is caused by more than one mechanism. Reduced dopamine transmission and hyperprolactinaemia decrease libido; antimuscarinic effects can cause disorders of arousal; and alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonists are associated with erection and ejaculation problems in men. Risperidone and haloperidol commonly cause sexual dysfunction. If sexual dysfunction is thought to be antipsychotic-induced, dose reduction or switching medication should be considered. </p><p>Antipsychotic drugs have been associated with cardiovascular side-effects such as tachycardia, arrhythmias (see under <a title="BNF:target-block: Antipsychotics monitoring" href="PHP2194-antipsychotic-drugs.htm#PHP2208">Monitoring</a>), and hypotension (see below). QT-interval prolongation is a particular concern with pimozide (see <a title="BNF:target-block: Pimozide CSM warning" href="PHP2244-pimozide.htm#PHP2245">ECG monitoring</a> in pimozide monograph) and haloperidol. There is also a higher probability of QT-interval prolongation in patients using any intravenous antipsychotic drug, or any antipsychotic drug or combination of antipsychotic drugs with doses exceeding the recommended maximum. Cases of sudden death have occurred.</p><p>Hyperglycaemia and sometimes diabetes can occur with antipsychotic drugs, particularly clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. All antipsychotic drugs may cause weight gain, but the risk and extent varies. Clozapine and olanzapine commonly cause weight gain.</p><p><em>Hypotension and interference with temperature regulation</em> are dose-related side-effects that are liable to cause dangerous falls and hypothermia or hyperthermia in the elderly. Clozapine, chlorpromazine, and quetiapine can cause postural hypotension (especially during initial dose titration) which may be associated with syncope or reflex tachycardia in some patients.</p><p><em>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</em> (hyperthermia, fluctuating level of consciousness, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction with pallor, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, sweating, and urinary incontinence) is a rare but potentially fatal side-effect of all antipsychotic drugs. Discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug is essential because there is no proven effective treatment, but <a title="BNF:monograph: BROMOCRIPTINE" href="PHP4705-bromocriptine.htm">bromocriptine</a> and <a title="BNF:monograph: DANTROLENE SODIUM" href="PHP8661-dantrolene-sodium.htm">dantrolene</a> have been used. The syndrome, which usually lasts for 5–7 days after drug discontinuation, may be unduly prolonged if depot preparations have been used.</p><p>Hypersalivation associated with clozapine therapy can be treated with <a title="BNF:monograph: HYOSCINE HYDROBROMIDE" href="PHP2576-hyoscine-hydrobromide.htm">hyoscine hydrobromide</a> [unlicensed indication], provided that the patient is not at particular risk from the additive antimuscarinic side-effects of hyoscine and clozapine.</p><p><em>Other side-effects include:</em> drowsiness; apathy; agitation, excitement and insomnia; convulsions; dizziness; headache; confusion; gastro-intestinal disturbances; nasal congestion; antimuscarinic symptoms (such as dry mouth, constipation, difficulty with micturition, and blurred vision; <em>very rarely</em>, precipitation of angle-closure glaucoma); venous thromboembolism; blood dyscrasias (such as agranulocytosis and leucopenia), photosensitisation, contact sensitisation and rashes, and jaundice (including cholestatic); corneal and lens opacities, and purplish pigmentation of the skin, cornea, conjunctiva, and retina.</p><p><strong>Overdosage:</strong> for poisoning with phenothiazines and related compounds and atypical antipsychotic drugs, see <a title="monograph-family: Phenothiazines and related drugs" href="PHP216-phenothiazines-and-related-drugs.htm">Emergency Treatment of Poisoning</a>.</p></div> <div id="PHP2207"><h2>Choice</h2><p>There is little meaningful difference in efficacy between each of the antipsychotic drugs (other than clozapine), and response and tolerability to each antipsychotic drug varies. There is no first-line antipsychotic drug which is suitable for all patients. Choice of antipsychotic medication is influenced by the patient’s medication history, the degree of sedation required (although tolerance to this usually develops), and consideration of individual patient factors such as risk of extrapyramidal side-effects, weight gain, impaired glucose tolerance, QT-interval prolongation, or the presence of negative symptoms.</p><p>Second generation antipsychotic drugs may be better at treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Similarly, second-generation antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed if extrapyramidal side-effects are a particular concern. Of these, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine are least likely to cause extrapyramidal side-effects. Although amisulpride is a dopamine-receptor antagonist, extrapyramidal side-effects are less common than with the first-generation antipsychotic drugs because amisulpride selectively blocks mesolimbic dopamine receptors, and extrapyramidal symptoms are caused by blockade of the striatal dopamine pathway.</p><p>Aripiprazole has negligible effect on the QT interval. Other antipsychotic drugs with a reduced tendency to prolong QT interval include amisulpride, clozapine, flupentixol, fluphenazine, olanzapine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, risperidone, and sulpiride.</p><p>Schizophrenia is associated with insulin resistance and diabetes; the risk of diabetes is increased in patients with schizophrenia who take antipsychotic drugs. First-generation antipsychotic drugs are less likely to cause diabetes than second-generation antipsychotic drugs, and of the first-generation antipsychotic drugs, fluphenazine and haloperidol are lowest risk. Amisulpride and aripiprazole have the lowest risk of diabetes of the second-generation antipsychotic drugs. Amisulpride, aripiprazole, haloperidol, sulpiride, and trifluoperazine are least likely to cause weight gain.</p><p>The antipsychotic drugs with the lowest risk of sexual dysfunction are aripiprazole and quetiapine. Olanzapine may be considered if sexual dysfunction is judged to be secondary to hyperprolactinaemia. Hyperprolactinaemia is usually not clinically significant with aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine treatment. When changing from other antipsychotic drugs, a reduction in prolactin concentration may increase fertility.</p><p>Patients should receive an antipsychotic drug for 4–6 weeks before it is deemed ineffective. Prescribing more than one antipsychotic drug at a time should be avoided except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. clozapine augmentation or when changing medication during titration) because of the increased risk of adverse effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, QT-interval prolongation, and sudden cardiac death.</p><p>Clozapine is licensed for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, other antipsychotic drugs. Clozapine should be introduced if schizophrenia is not controlled despite the sequential use of two or more antipsychotic drugs (one of which should be a second-generation antipsychotic drug), each for at least 6–8 weeks. If symptoms do not respond adequately to an optimised dose of clozapine, plasma-clozapine concentration should be checked before adding a second antipsychotic drug to augment clozapine; allow 8–10 weeks’ treatment to assess response. Patients must be registered with a clozapine patient monitoring service (see under <a title="BNF:monograph: CLOZAPINE" href="PHP2273-clozapine.htm">Clozapine</a>).</p></div> <div id="PHP2208"><h2>Monitoring</h2><p>Full blood count, urea and electrolytes, and liver function test monitoring is required at the start of therapy with antipsychotic drugs, and then annually thereafter. Amisulpride and sulpiride do not require liver function test monitoring. Clozapine requires differential white blood cell monitoring weekly for 18 weeks, then fortnightly for up to one year, and then monthly as part of the clozapine patient monitoring service.</p><p>Blood lipids and weight should be measured at baseline, at 3 months (weight should be measured at frequent intervals during the first 3 months), and then yearly. Patients taking clozapine or olanzapine require more frequent monitoring of these parameters: every 3 months for the first year, then yearly.</p><p>Fasting blood glucose should be measured at baseline, at 4–6 months, and then yearly. Patients taking clozapine or olanzapine should have fasting blood glucose tested at baseline, after one months’ treatment, then every 4–6 months.</p><p>Before initiating antipsychotic drugs, an ECG may be required, particularly if physical examination identifies cardiovascular risk factors, if there is a personal history of cardiovascular disease, or if the patient is being admitted as an inpatient. ECG monitoring is advised for haloperidol and mandatory for pimozide (see under individual drugs and Side-effects above).</p><p>Blood pressure monitoring is advised before starting therapy and frequently during dose titration of antipsychotic drugs. Amisulpride, aripiprazole, trifluoperazine, and sulpiride do not affect blood pressure to the same extent as other antipsychotic drugs and so blood pressure monitoring is not mandatory for these drugs.</p><p>It is advisable to monitor prolactin concentration at the start of therapy, at 6 months, and then yearly. Patients taking antipsychotic drugs not normally associated with symptomatic hyperprolactinaemia (see <a title="BNF:target-block: Antipsychotics choice" href="PHP2194-antipsychotic-drugs.htm#PHP2207">Choice</a> above) should be considered for prolactin monitoring if they show symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia (such as breast enlargement and galactorrhoea).</p><p>Patients with schizophrenia should have physical health monitoring (including cardiovascular disease risk assessment) at least once per year.</p></div> <div><h2>Other uses</h2><p>Nausea and vomiting (<a title=" Drugs used in nausea and vertigo" href="PHP2505-drugs-used-in-nausea-and-vertigo.htm">section 4.6</a>), choreas, motor tics (<a title=" Drugs used in essential tremor, chorea, tics, and related disorders" href="PHP3157-drugs-used-in-essential-tremor-chorea-tics-and-related-disorders.htm">section 4.9.3</a>), and intractable hiccup (see under Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride and under Haloperidol). <strong>Benperidol</strong> is used in deviant antisocial sexual behaviour but its value is not established; see also <a title="monograph-family: Anti-androgens" href="PHP4541-anti-androgens.htm">section 6.4.2</a> for the role of cyproterone acetate.</p><p>Psychomotor agitation should be investigated for an underlying cause; it can be managed with low doses of chlorpromazine or haloperidol used for short periods.
