Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971 prohibits certain activities in relation
to ‘Controlled Drugs’, in particular their manufacture, supply, and
possession. The penalties applicable to offences involving the different
drugs are graded broadly according to the <i>harmfulness attributable
to a drug when it is misused</i> and for this purpose the drugs
are defined in the following three classes:</p><ul class="cBD"><li><p class="cQ"><b>Class A</b> includes: <span>alfentanil</span>, cocaine, <span>diamorphine (heroin)</span>, <span>dipipanone</span>, lysergide (LSD), methadone, methylenedioxymethamfetamine
(MDMA, ‘ecstasy’), <span>morphine</span>, <span>opium</span>, <span>pethidine</span>, <span>phencyclidine</span>, <span>remifentanil</span>, and class B substances when prepared for
injection</p></li><li><p class="cQ"><b>Class B</b> includes: oral ampfetamines, <span>barbiturates</span>, cannabis, cannabis resin, codeine, ethylmorphine,
glutethimide, nabilone, <span>pentazocine</span>, phenmetrazine,
and <span>pholcodine</span></p></li><li><p class="cQ"><b>Class C</b> includes: certain drugs related

gonadotrophin</span>, somatotropin, somatrem, and <span>somatropin</span></p></li></ul><p>The Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 define the classes of person who
are authorised to supply and possess controlled drugs while acting
in their professional capacities and lay down the conditions under
which these activities may be carried out. In the regulations drugs
are divided into five schedules each specifying the requirements governing
such activities as import, export, production, supply, possession,
prescribing, and record keeping which apply to them.</p><ul class="cBD"><li><p class="cQ"><b>Schedule 1</b> includes drugs such as cannabis
and lysergide which are not used medicinally. Possession and supply
are prohibited except in accordance with Home Office authority.</p></li><li><p class="cQ"><b>Schedule 2</b> includes drugs such as diamorphine
(heroin), <span>morphine</span>, nabilone, <span>remifentanil</span>, <span>pethidine</span>, <span>secobarbital</span>, <span>glutethimide</span>, <span>amfetamine</span>, and <span>cocaine</span> and are subject to the full controlled drug requirements
relating to prescriptions, safe custody (except for <span>secobarbital</span>), the need to keep registers, etc. (unless exempted in Schedule
5).</p></li><li><p class="cQ"><b>Schedule 3</b> includes the <span>barbiturates</span> (except secobarbital, now Schedule 2), <span>buprenorphine</span>, diethylpropion, mazindol, <span>meprobamate</span>, midazolam, <span>pentazocine</span>, <span>phentermine</span>, and <span>temazepam</span>.

requirements (except for <span>temazepam</span>) and to the
safe custody requirements (except for any 5,5 disubstituted barbituric
acid (e.g. phenobarbital), mazindol, meprobamate, midazolam, pentazocine,
phentermine, or any stereoisomeric form or salts of the above). Records
in registers do not need to be kept (although there are requirements
for the retention of invoices for 2 years).</p></li><li><p class="cQ"><b>Schedule 4</b> includes in Part I benzodiazepines
(except <span>temazepam</span> and midazolam, which are in Schedule
3) and zolpidem, which are subject to minimal control. Part II includes
androgenic and anabolic steroids, clenbuterol, <span>chorionic
gonadotrophin</span> (HCG), non-human <span>chorionic gonadotrophin</span>, somatotropin, somatrem, and <span>somatropin</span>. Controlled
drug prescription requirements do not apply and Schedule 4 Controlled
Drugs are not subject to safe custody requirements.</p></li><li><p class="cQ"><b>Schedule 5</b> includes those preparations

2, 3, and 4 to be limited to a supply of up to 30 days’ treatment;
exceptionally, to cover a justifiable clinical need and after consideration
of any risk, a prescription can be issued for a longer period, but

addiction are <b>cocaine</b>, <b>diamorphine </b> (heroin), <b><span>morphine</span></b>, and the<b> synthetic opioids</b>. For arrangements for prescribing
of diamorphine, dipipanone, or cocaine for addicts, see <a title="topic: Prescribing of diamorphine (heroin), dipipanone, and cocaine for addicts" href="129783.htm#_129783">Prescribing of Diamorphine
(heroin) Dipipanone, and Cocaine for Addicts</a>.</p><p>Despite marked reduction in the prescribing of <b>amfetamines</b>, there is concern that abuse of illicit amfetamine and related compounds
is widespread.</p> <p class="cAX"><b>Benzodiazepines</b> are commonly misused. However, the
misuse of <b>barbiturates</b> is now uncommon, in line with
declining medicinal use and consequent availability.</p><p><b>Cannabis</b> (Indian hemp) has no approved medicinal
use and cannot be prescribed by doctors. Its use is illegal but widespread.
Cannabis is a mild hallucinogen seldom accompanied by a desire to
increase the dose; withdrawal symptoms are unusual. <b>Lysergide</b> (lysergic acid diethylamide, LSD) is a
much more potent hallucinogen; its use can lead to severe psychotic
states which can be life-threatening.</p><p>There are concerns over increases in the availability and misuse
of other drugs with variously combined hallucinogenic, anaesthetic,
or sedative properties. These include ketamine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (sodium oxybate, GHB).</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Supervised consumption</h2> <p class="cAX">Individuals
prescribed opioid substitution therapy (<a title="BNF:monograph-family: Opioid substitution therapy" href="213722.htm#_213722">section 4.10.3</a>) can
take their daily dose under the supervision of a doctor, nurse, or
pharmacist during the dose stabilisation phase (usually the first
3 months of treatment), after a relapse or period of instability,
or if there is a significant increase in the dose of methadone. Supervised
consumption should continue (in accordance with local protocols) until
the prescriber is confident that the patient is compliant with their
treatment.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Prescribing drugs likely to cause dependence or misuse</h2> <p class="cAX">The prescriber has three main responsibilities:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">To avoid creating dependence by introducing drugs to patients
without sufficient reason. In this context, the proper use of the <span>morphine</span>-like drugs is well understood. The dangers of
other Controlled Drugs are less clear because recognition of dependence
is not easy and its effects, and those of withdrawal, are less obvious.</p></li><li><p class="cQ">To see that the patient does not gradually increase the
dose of a drug, given for good medical reasons, to the point where
dependence becomes more likely. This tendency is seen especially with
hypnotics and anxiolytics (for CSM advice see <a title=" Hypnotics and anxiolytics" href="3139.htm#_3139">section 4.1</a>). The prescriber should keep a
close eye on the amount prescribed to prevent patients from accumulating
stocks. A minimal amount should be prescribed in the first instance,
or when seeing a new patient for the first time.</p></li><li><p class="cQ">To avoid being used as an unwitting source of supply for
addicts. Methods include visiting more than one doctor, fabricating
stories, and forging prescriptions.</p></li></ul><p>Patients under temporary care should be given only small supplies
of drugs unless they present an unequivocal letter from their own
doctor. Doctors should also remember that their own patients may be
attempting to collect prescriptions from other prescribers, especially
in hospitals. It is sensible to reduce dosages steadily or to issue
weekly or even daily prescriptions for small amounts if it is apparent
that dependence is occurring.</p><p>The stealing and misuse of prescription forms could be minimised
by the following precautions:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">do not leave unattended if called away from the consulting
room or at reception desks; do not leave in a car where they may be
visible; when not in use, keep in a locked drawer within the surgery
and at home;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">draw a diagonal line across the blank part of the form
under the prescription;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">write the quantity in words and figures when prescribing
drugs prone to abuse; this is obligatory for controlled drugs (see
Prescriptions, above);</p></li><li><p class="cQ">alterations are best avoided but if any are made they
should be clear and unambiguous; add initials against altered items;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">if prescriptions are left for collection they should be
left in a safe place in a sealed envelope.</p></li></ul></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Travelling abroad</h2> <p class="cAX">Prescribed drugs listed in Schedule
4 Part II (CD Anab) and Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations
2001 are not subject to export or import licensing. However, patients
intending to travel abroad for more than 3 months carrying any amount
of drugs listed in Schedules 2, 3, or 4 Part I (CD Benz) will require
a personal export/import licence. Further details can be obtained
at <br /><a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/licensing/personal" title="external link">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/licensing/personal</a>,<br /> or
from the Home Office by contacting licensing_enquiry.aadu@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk
(in cases of emergency, telephone (020) 7035 0484).</p><p>Applications must be supported by a covering letter from the
prescriber and should give details of:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">the patient’s name and address; </p></li><li><p class="cQ">the quantities of drugs to be carried; </p></li><li><p class="cQ">the strength and form in which the drugs will be dispensed;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">the country or countries of destination;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">the dates of travel to and from the United Kingdom.</p></li></ul><p>Applications for licences should be sent to the Home Office,
Drugs Licensing, Peel Building, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF.
Alternatively, completed application forms can be emailed to licensing_enquiry.aadu@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk
with a scanned copy of the covering letter from the prescriber. A
minimum of two weeks should be allowed for processing the application.</p><p>Patients travelling for less than 3 months do not require a
personal export/import licence for carrying Controlled Drugs, but
are advised to carry a letter from the prescribing doctor. Those travelling
for more than 3 months are advised to make arrangements to have their
medication prescribed by a practitioner in the country they are visiting.</p><p>Doctors who want to take Controlled Drugs abroad while accompanying
patients may similarly be issued with licences. Licences are not normally
issued to doctors who want to take Controlled Drugs abroad solely
in case a family emergency should arise.</p><p>Personal export/import licences do not have any legal status
outside the UK and are issued only to comply with the Misuse of Drugs
Act and to facilitate passage through UK Customs and Excise control.
For clearance in the country to be visited it is necessary to approach
that country’s consulate in the UK.</p></div></div><?highlighter on?><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li><a href="129781.htm" title="Notification of patients receiving structured drug treatment&#xA;for substance dependence">Notification of patients receiving structured drug treatment
