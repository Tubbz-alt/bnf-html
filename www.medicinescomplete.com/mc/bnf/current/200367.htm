ones are shown below.</p><div class="cAZ"><h2>Summaries of product characteristics</h2><p>The BNF receives
summaries of product characteristics (SPCs) of all new products as
well as revised SPCs for existing products. The SPCs are the principal
source of product information and are carefully processed, despite
the ever-increasing volume of information being issued by the pharmaceutical
industry. Such processing involves:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">verifying the approved names of all relevant ingredients
including ‘non-active’ ingredients (the BNF is committed to using
approved names and descriptions as laid down by the Medicines Act);</p></li><li><p class="cQ">comparing the indications, cautions, contra-indications,
and side-effects with similar existing drugs. Where these are different
from the expected pattern, justification is sought for their inclusion
or exclusion;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">seeking independent data on the use of drugs in pregnancy
and breast-feeding;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">incorporating the information into the BNF using established
criteria for the presentation and inclusion of the data;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">checking interpretation of the information by two staff
editors before submitting to a senior editor; changes relating to
doses receive an extra check;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">identifying potential clinical problems or omissions and
seeking further information from manufacturers or from expert advisers;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">careful validation of any areas of divergence of the BNF
from the SPC before discussion by the Committee (in the light of supporting
evidence);</p></li><li><p class="cQ">constructing, with the help of expert advisers, a comment
on the role of the drug in the context of similar drugs.</p></li></ul><p>Much of this processing is applicable to the following sources
as well.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Expert advisers</h2> <p class="cAX">The role of expert clinical advisers
in providing the appropriate clinical context for all BNF information
is discussed above.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Literature</h2> <p class="cAX">Staff editors monitor core medical
and pharmaceutical journals. Research papers and reviews relating
to drug therapy are carefully processed. When a difference between
the advice in the BNF and the paper is noted, the new information
is assessed for reliability and relevance to UK clinical practice.
If necessary, new text is drafted and discussed with expert advisers
and the Joint Formulary Committee. The BNF enjoys a close working
relationship with a number of national information providers.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Systematic reviews</h2> <p class="cAX">The BNF has access to various
databases of systematic reviews (including the Cochrane Library and
various web-based resources). These are used for answering specific
queries, for reviewing existing text and for constructing new text.
Staff editors receive training in critical appraisal, literature evaluation,
and search strategies. Reviews published in Clinical Evidence are
used to validate BNF advice.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Consensus guidelines</h2> <p class="cAX">The advice in the BNF is
checked against consensus guidelines produced by expert bodies. A
number of bodies make drafts or pre-publication copies of the guidelines
available to the BNF; it is therefore possible to ensure that a consistent
message is disseminated. The BNF routinely processes guidelines from
the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE),
the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), and the Scottish Intercollegiate
Guidelines Network (SIGN).</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Reference sources</h2> <p class="cAX">Textbooks and reference sources
are used to provide background information for the review of existing
text or for the construction of new text. The BNF team works closely
with the editorial team that produces <i>Martindale: The Complete
Drug Reference</i>. The BNF has access to <i>Martindale</i> information resources and each team keeps the other informed of
significant developments and shifts in the trends of drug usage.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Statutory information</h2> <p class="cAX">The BNF routinely processes
relevant information from various Government bodies including Statutory
Instruments and regulations affecting the Prescription only Medicines
Order. Official compendia such as the British Pharmacopoeia and its
addenda are processed routinely to ensure that the BNF complies with
the relevant sections of the Medicines Act. The BNF itself is named
as an official compendium in the Medicines Act.</p><p>The BNF maintains close links with the Home Office (in relation
to controlled drug regulations) and the Medicines and Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency (including the British Pharmacopoeia Commission).
Safety warnings issued by the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM)
and guidelines on drug use issued by the UK health departments are
processed as a matter of routine.</p><p>Relevant professional statements issued by the Royal Pharmaceutical
Society are included in the BNF as are guidelines from bodies such
as the Royal College of General Practitioners.</p><p>The BNF reflects information from the Drug Tariff, the Scottish
Drug Tariff, and the Northern Ireland Drug Tariff.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Pricing information</h2> <p class="cAX">NHS Prescription Services
(from the NHS Business Services Authority) provides information on
prices of medicinal products and appliances in the BNF.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Comments from readers</h2> <p class="cAX">Readers of the BNF are invited
to send in comments. Numerous letters and emails are received during
the preparation of each edition. Such feedback helps to ensure that
the BNF provides practical and clinically relevant information. Many
changes in the presentation and scope of the BNF have resulted from
comments sent in by users.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Comments from industry</h2> <p class="cAX">Close scrutiny of the BNF
by the manufacturers provides an additional check and allows them
an opportunity to raise issues about the BNF’s presentation of the
role of various drugs; this is yet another check on the balance of
the BNF’s advice. All comments are looked at with care and, where
necessary, additional information and expert advice are sought.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Virtual user groups </h2> <p class="cAX">The BNF has set up virtual
user groups across various healthcare professions (e.g. doctors, pharmacists,
nurses, dentists). The aim of these groups will be to provide feedback
to the editors and publishers to ensure that BNF publications continue
to serve the needs of its users.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Market research </h2> <p class="cAX">Market research is conducted
at regular intervals to gather feedback on specific areas of development,
such as drug interactions or changes to the way information is presented
in digital formats.</p></div><div class="cN"><p>The BNF is an independent professional publication
that is kept up-to-date and addresses the day-to-day prescribing information
needs of healthcare professionals. Use of this resource throughout
the health service helps to ensure that medicines are used safely,
effectively, and appropriately.</p></div></div><?highlighter on?><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="200366.htm">Previous: Expert advisers</a> | <a class="top" href="200367.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="35095.htm">Next: How to use the BNF</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="35091.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain 2012.
