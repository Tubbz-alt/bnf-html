It is a polypeptide hormone of complex structure. There are differences in the amino-acid sequence of animal insulins, human insulins and the human insulin analogues. Insulin may be extracted from pork pancreas and purified by crystallisation; it may also be extracted from beef pancreas, but beef insulins are now rarely used. Human sequence insulin may be produced semisynthetically by enzymatic modification of porcine insulin (emp) or biosynthetically by recombinant DNA technology using bacteria (crb, prb) or yeast (pyr).</p><p>All insulin preparations are to a greater or lesser extent immunogenic in man but immunological resistance to insulin action is uncommon. Preparations of human sequence insulin should theoretically be less immunogenic, but no real advantage has been shown in trials.</p><p>Insulin is inactivated by gastro-intestinal enzymes, and must therefore be given by injection; the subcutaneous route is ideal in most circumstances. Insulin is usually injected into the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen; absorption from a limb site may be increased if the limb is used in strenuous exercise after the injection. Generally subcutaneous insulin injections cause few problems; lipodystrophy may occur but can be minimised by using different injection sites in rotation. Local allergic reactions are rare.</p><p>Insulin is needed by all patients with ketoacidosis, and it is likely to be needed by most patients with:</p><ul><li><p>rapid onset of symptoms;</p> </li><li><p>substantial loss of weight;</p> </li><li><p>weakness;</p> </li><li><p>ketonuria;</p> </li><li><p>a first-degree relative who has type 1 diabetes.</p> </li></ul><p>Insulin is required by almost all children with diabetes. It is also needed for type 2 diabetes when other methods have failed to achieve good control, and temporarily in the presence of intercurrent illness or peri-operatively. Pregnant women with type 2 diabetes may be treated with insulin when diet alone fails. For advice on use of oral antidiabetic drugs in the management of diabetes in pregnancy, see <a title="BNF:target-block: Antidiabetic drugs and pregnancy and breast-feeding" href="PHP4127-antidiabetic-drugs.htm#PHP4128">section 6.1.2</a>.</p><div class="cI"><p class="cAE">NHS Diabetes guidance</p><h3 class="cT">Safe and Effective Use of Insulin in Hospitalised Patients (March 2010)</h3><p>Available at <a href="http://www.diabetes.nhs.uk">www.diabetes.nhs.uk</a></p></div><div><h2>Management of diabetes with insulin</h2><p>The aim of treatment is to achieve the best possible control of blood-glucose concentration without making the patient obsessional and to avoid disabling hypoglycaemia; close co-operation is needed between the patient and the medical team because good control reduces the risk of complications.</p></div><p>Insulin preparations can be divided into 3 types:</p><ul><li><p>those of <strong>short</strong> duration which have a relatively rapid onset of action, namely soluble insulin and the rapid-acting insulin analogues, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine, and insulin lispro (<a title="BNF:sub-sub-section: Short-acting insulins" href="PHP4047-short-acting-insulins.htm">section 6.1.1.1</a>);</p> </li><li><p>those with an <strong>intermediate</strong> action, e.g. isophane insulin (<a title="BNF:sub-sub-section: Intermediate- and long-acting insulins" href="PHP4067-intermediate-and-long-acting-insulins.htm">section 6.1.1.2</a>); and</p> </li><li><p>those whose action is slower in onset and lasts for <strong>long</strong> periods, e.g. protamine zinc insulin, insulin detemir, and insulin glargine (<a title="BNF:sub-sub-section: Intermediate- and long-acting insulins" href="PHP4067-intermediate-and-long-acting-insulins.htm">section 6.1.1.2</a>).</p> </li></ul><p>The duration of action of a particular type of insulin varies considerably from one patient to another, and needs to be assessed individually.</p><p>Mixtures of insulin preparations may be required and appropriate combinations have to be determined for the individual patient. Treatment should be started with a short-acting insulin (e.g. soluble insulin) or a rapid-acting insulin analogue (e.g. insulin aspart) given before meals with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin once or twice daily. Alternatively, for those who have difficulty with, or prefer not to use, multiple injection regimens, a mixture of premixed short-acting insulin or rapid acting insulin analogue with an intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin (most commonly in a proportion of 30% soluble insulin and 70% isophane insulin) can be given once or twice daily. The dose of short-acting or rapid-acting insulin (or the proportion of the short-acting soluble insulin component in premixed insulin) can be increased in those with excessive postprandial hyperglycaemia. The dose of insulin is increased gradually according to the patient's individual requirements, taking care to avoid troublesome hypoglycaemic reactions.</p><p id="PHP4036">Insulin requirements may be increased by infection, stress, accidental or surgical trauma, and during puberty. Requirements may be decreased in those with certain endocrine disorders (e.g. Addison's disease, hypopituitarism), or in coeliac disease.</p><div><h2>Examples of recommended insulin regimens</h2><ul><li><p>Multiple injection regimen: short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue, before meals <br />With intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin, once or twice daily;</p> </li><li><p>Short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue mixed with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin, once or twice daily (before meals);</p> </li><li><p>Intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin, once or twice daily<br />With or without short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin before meals;</p> </li><li><p>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (see below).</p> </li></ul></div><div id="PHP4037"><h2>Hepatic impairment</h2><p>Insulin requirements may be decreased in patients with hepatic impairment.</p></div><div id="PHP4038"><h2>Renal impairment</h2><p>Insulin requirements may decrease in patients with renal impairment and therefore dose reduction may be necessary. The compensatory response to hypoglycaemia is impaired in renal impairment.</p></div><div id="PHP4039"><h2>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</h2><p>During pregnancy and breast-feeding, insulin requirements may alter and doses should be assessed frequently by an experienced diabetes physician. The dose of insulin generally needs to be increased in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The short-acting insulin analogues, insulin aspart and insulin lispro, are not known to be harmful, and may be used during pregnancy and lactation. Evidence of the safety of long-acting insulin analogues in pregnancy is limited, therefore isophane insulin is recommended where longer-acting insulins are needed; insulin detemir may also be considered.</p></div><div id="PHP4040"><h2>Insulin administration</h2><p>Insulin is generally given by <em>subcutaneous injection</em>; the injection site should be rotated to prevent lipodystrophy. Injection devices (‘pens’) (<a title=" Hypodermic equipment" href="PHP4105-hypodermic-equipment.htm">section 6.1.1.3</a>), which hold the insulin in a cartridge and meter the required dose, are convenient to use. Insulin syringes (for use with needles) are required for insulins not available in cartridge form.</p><p>For intensive insulin regimens multiple subcutaneous injections (3 or more times daily) are usually recommended.</p><p>Short-acting injectable insulins (soluble insulin, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine, and insulin lispro) can also be given by <em>continuous subcutaneous infusion</em> using a portable infusion pump. This device delivers a continuous basal insulin infusion and patient-activated bolus doses at meal times. This technique can be useful for patients who suffer recurrent hypoglycaemia or marked morning rise in blood-glucose concentration despite optimised multiple-injection regimens (see also NICE guidance, <a title="BNF:target-block: Nice guidance box subcut insulin" href="PHP4035-insulins.htm#PHP4041">below</a>). Patients on subcutaneous insulin infusion must be highly motivated, able to monitor their blood-glucose concentration, and have expert training, advice and supervision from an experienced healthcare team.</p> <div id="PHP4041" class="cI"><p class="cAE">NICE guidance</p><h3 class="cT">Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (type 1) (July 2008)</h3><p>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is recommended as an option in adults and children over 12 years with type 1 diabetes:</p><ul><li><p>who suffer repeated or unpredictable hypoglycaemia, whilst attempting to achieve optimal glycaemic control with multiple-injection regimens, <strong>or</strong></p> </li><li><p>whose glycaemic control remains inadequate (HbA<sub>1c</sub> over 8.5% [69 mmol/mol]) despite optimised multiple-injection regimens (including the use of long-acting insulin analogues where appropriate).</p> </li></ul><p>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is also recommended as an option for children under 12 years with type 1 diabetes for whom multiple-injection regimens are considered impractical or inappropriate. Children on insulin pumps should undergo a trial of multiple-injection therapy between the ages of 12 and 18 years.</p></div>  <p>Soluble insulin by the <em>intravenous route</em> is reserved for urgent treatment, e.g. in diabetic ketoacidosis, and for fine control in serious illness and in the peri-operative period (see under Diabetes and Surgery, below).</p></div><div><h2>Units</h2><p>The word ‘unit’ should <strong>not</strong> be abbreviated.</p></div><div><h2>Monitoring</h2><p>Many patients now monitor their own blood-glucose concentrations (<a title=" Diagnostic and monitoring agents for diabetes mellitus" href="PHP4235-diagnostic-and-monitoring-devices-for-diabetes-mellitus.htm">section 6.1.6</a>). Since blood-glucose concentration varies substantially throughout the day, ‘normoglycaemia’ cannot always be achieved throughout a 24-hour period without causing damaging hypoglycaemia. It is therefore best to recommend that patients should maintain a blood-glucose concentration of between 4 and 9 mmol/litre for most of the time (4–7 mmol/litre before meals and less than 9 mmol/litre after meals), while accepting that on occasions, for brief periods, it will be above these values; strenuous efforts should be made to prevent the blood-glucose concentration from falling below 4 mmol/litre. Patients using multiple injection regimens should understand how to adjust their insulin dose according to their carbohydrate intake. With fixed-dose insulin regimens, the carbohydrate intake needs to be regulated, and should be distributed throughout the day to match the insulin regimen. The intake of energy and of simple and complex carbohydrates should be adequate to allow normal growth and development but obesity must be avoided.</p></div><div id="PHP4042"><h2>Hypoglycaemia</h2><p>Hypoglycaemia is a potential problem with insulin therapy. All patients must be carefully instructed on how to avoid it.</p><p>Loss of warning of hypoglycaemia among insulin-treated patients can be a serious hazard, especially for drivers and those in dangerous occupations. Very tight control of diabetes lowers the blood-glucose concentration needed to trigger hypoglycaemic symptoms; an increase in the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes may reduce the warning symptoms experienced by the patient. Beta-blockers can also blunt hypoglycaemic awareness (and also delay recovery).</p><p>To restore the warning signs, episodes of hypoglycaemia must be minimised; this involves appropriate adjustment of insulin type, dose and frequency together with suitable timing and quantity of meals and snacks.</p><p>Some patients have reported loss of hypoglycaemia warning after transfer to human insulin. Clinical studies do not confirm that human insulin decreases hypoglycaemia awareness. If a patient believes that human insulin is responsible for the loss of warning it is reasonable to revert to animal insulin and essential to educate the patient about avoiding hypoglycaemia. Great care should be taken to specify whether a human or an animal preparation is required.</p><p>Few patients are now treated with beef insulins; when undertaking conversion from beef to human insulin, the total dose should be reduced by about 10% with careful monitoring for the first few days. When changing between pork and human-sequence insulins, a dose change is not usually needed, but careful monitoring is still advised.</p></div><div id="PHP4046"><h2>Diabetes and surgery</h2><p>Perioperative control of blood-glucose concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes is achieved via an adjustable, continuous, intravenous infusion of insulin. Detailed local protocols should be available to all healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of these patients; in general, the following steps should be followed:</p><ul><li><p>Give an injection of the patient's usual insulin on the night before the operation;</p> </li><li><p>Early on the day of the operation, start an intravenous infusion of glucose containing potassium chloride (provided that the patient is not hyperkalaemic) and infuse at a constant rate appropriate to the patient's fluid requirements (usually 125 mL per hour); make up a solution of soluble insulin in sodium chloride 0.9% and infuse intravenously using a syringe pump piggy-backed to the intravenous infusion. Glucose and potassium infusions, and insulin infusions should be made up according to locally agreed protocols;</p> </li><li><p>The rate of the insulin infusion should be adjusted according to blood-glucose concentration (frequent monitoring necessary) in line with locally agreed protocols. Other factors affecting the rate of infusion include the patient's volume depletion, cardiac function, and age.</p> </li></ul><p>Protocols should include specific instructions on how to manage resistant cases (such as patients who are in shock or severely ill or those receiving corticosteroids or sympathomimetics) and those with hypoglycaemia.</p><p>If a syringe pump is not available, soluble insulin should be added to the intravenous infusion of glucose and potassium chloride (provided the patient is not hyperkalaemic), and the infusion run at the rate appropriate to the patient's fluid requirements (usually 125 mL per hour) with the insulin dose adjusted according to blood-glucose concentration in line with locally agreed protocols.</p><p>Once the patient starts to eat and drink, give subcutaneous insulin before breakfast and stop intravenous insulin 30 minutes later; the dose may need to be 10–20% more than usual if the patient is still in bed or unwell. If the patient was not previously receiving insulin, an appropriate initial dose is 30–40 units daily in four divided doses using soluble insulin before meals and intermediate-acting insulin at bedtime and the dose adjusted from day to day. Patients with hyperglycaemia often relapse after conversion back to subcutaneous insulin calling for one of the following approaches:</p><ul><li><p>additional doses of soluble insulin at any of the four injection times (before meals or bedtime) <em>or</em></p> </li><li><p>temporary addition of intravenous insulin infusion (while continuing the subcutaneous regimen) until blood-glucose concentration is satisfactory <em>or</em></p> </li><li><p>complete reversion to the intravenous regimen (especially if the patient is unwell).</p> </li></ul></div><div><h2>Insulin Passport</h2><p>Insulin Passports and patient information booklets should be offered to patients receiving insulin. The Insulin Passport provides a record of the patient’s current insulin preparations and contains a section for emergency information.
