and in all cases the benefit of administering the medicine should
be considered in relation to the risk involved. This is particularly
important during pregnancy, when the risk to both mother and fetus
must be considered (for further details see <a title="BNF:prelim-section: Prescribing in pregnancy" href="204163.htm#_204163">Prescribing in Pregnancy</a>).</p><p>It is important to discuss treatment options carefully with
the patient to ensure that the patient is content to take the medicine
as prescribed (see also Taking Medicines to Best Effect, below). In
particular, the patient should be helped to distinguish the adverse
effects of prescribed drugs from the effects of the medical disorder.
When the beneficial effects of the medicine are likely to be delayed,
the patient should be advised of this. </p><div class="cAZ"><h2>Taking medicines to best effect</h2> <p class="cAX">Difficulties in adherence to drug
treatment occur regardless of age. Factors contributing to poor compliance
with prescribed medicines include:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">prescription not collected or not dispensed;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">purpose of medicine not clear;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">perceived lack of efficacy;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">real or perceived adverse effects;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">patients’ perception of the risk and severity of side-effects
may differ from that of the prescriber;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">instructions for administration not clear;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">physical difficulty in taking medicines (e.g. swallowing
the medicine, handling small tablets, or opening medicine containers);</p></li><li><p class="cQ">unattractive formulation (e.g. unpleasant taste);</p></li><li><p class="cQ">complicated regimen.</p></li></ul><p>The prescriber and the patient
should agree on the health outcomes that the patient desires and on
the strategy for achieving them (‘concordance’). The prescriber should
be sensitive to religious, cultural, and personal beliefs that can
affect a patient’s acceptance of medicines.</p><p>Taking the time to explain to the patient (and relatives) the
rationale and the potential adverse effects of treatment may improve
adherence. Reinforcement and elaboration of the physician’s instructions
by the pharmacist and other members of the healthcare team also helps.
Advising the patient of the possibility of alternative treatments
may encourage the patient to seek advice rather than merely abandon
unacceptable treatment.</p><p>Simplifying the drug regimen may help; the need for frequent
administration may reduce adherence, although there appears to be
little difference in adherence between once-daily and twice-daily
administration. Combination products reduce the number of drugs taken
but at the expense of the ability to titrate individual doses.</p></div><div id="_200789"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Biosimilar medicines</h2> <p class="cAX">A biosimilar medicine is a new biological product that is similar
to a medicine that has already been authorised to be marketed (the
biological reference medicine) in the European Union. The active substance
of a biosimilar medicine is similar, but not identical, to the biological
reference medicine. Biological products are different from standard
chemical products in terms of their complexity and although theoretically
there should be no important differences between the biosimilar and
the biological reference medicine in terms of safety or efficacy,
when prescribing biological products, it is good practice to use the
brand name. This will ensure that substitution of a biosimilar medicine
does not occur when the medicine is dispensed.</p><p>Biosimilar medicines have black triangle status (<a href="204285.htm" title="Report adverse reaction(s)"><img class="cK" src="images/blacktri_l.png" alt="Black triangle" /></a>)
at the time of initial marketing. It is important to report suspected
adverse reactions to biosimilar medicines using the Yellow Card Scheme
(see <a title="prelim-section: Adverse reactions to drugs" href="29432.htm#_29432">Adverse Reactions to Drugs</a>). For biosimilar medicines, adverse reaction
reports should clearly state the brand name of the suspected medicine.</p></div></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Complementary and alternative medicine</h2> <p class="cAX">An increasing amount
of information on complementary  and alternative medicine is becoming available.
The scope of the BNF is restricted to the discussion of conventional
medicines but reference is made to complementary treatments if they
affect conventional therapy (e.g. interactions with St John’s wort—see
Appendix 1). Further information on herbal medicines is available at <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk" title="external link">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Abbreviation of titles</h2> <p class="cAX">In general, titles of drugs
and preparations should be written <i>in full</i>. Unofficial
abbreviations should not be used as they may be misinterpreted.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Non-proprietary titles</h2> <p class="cAX">Where non-proprietary (‘generic’) titles are given,
they should be used in prescribing. This will enable any suitable product to be dispensed,
thereby saving delay to the patient and sometimes expense to the health
service. The only exception is where there is a demonstrable difference
in clinical effect between each manufacturer’s version of the formulation,
making it important that the patient should always receive the same
brand; in such cases, the brand name or the manufacturer should be
stated. Non-proprietary titles should <b>not</b> be invented
for the purposes of prescribing generically since this can lead to
confusion, particularly in the case of compound and modified-release
preparations.</p><p>Titles used as headings for monographs may be used freely in
the United Kingdom but in other countries may be subject to restriction.</p><p>Many of the non-proprietary titles used in this book are titles
of monographs in the European Pharmacopoeia, British Pharmacopoeia,
or British Pharmaceutical Codex 1973. In such cases the preparations
must comply with the standard (if any) in the appropriate publication,
as required by the Medicines Act (Section 65).</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Proprietary titles</h2> <p class="cAX">Names followed by the symbol® are or have been used as
proprietary names in the United Kingdom. These names may in general
be applied only to products supplied by the owners of the trade marks.</p></div><div id="_120513"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Marketing authorisation and BNF advice</h2> <p class="cAX">In general the <i>doses, indications,
cautions, contra-indications,</i> and <i>side-effects</i> in the BNF reflect those in the manufacturers’ data sheets or Summaries
of Product Characteristics (SPCs) which, in turn, reflect those in
the corresponding marketing authorisations (formerly known as Product
Licences). The BNF does not generally include proprietary medicines
that are not supported by a valid Summary of Product Characteristics
or when the marketing authorisation holder has not been able to supply
essential information. When a preparation is available from more than
one manufacturer, the BNF reflects advice that is the most clinically
relevant regardless of any variation in the marketing authorisations.
Unlicensed products can be obtained from ‘special-order’ manufacturers
or specialist importing companies, see <a title="BNF:appendix: Special-order Manufacturers" href="106216.htm#_106216">Special-Order Manufacturers</a>.</p><p>Where an unlicensed drug is included in the BNF, this is indicated
in square brackets after the entry. When the BNF suggests a use (or
route) that is outside the licensed indication of a product (‘off-label’
use), this too is indicated. Unlicensed use of medicines becomes necessary
if the clinical need cannot be met by licensed medicines; such use
should be supported by appropriate evidence and experience. </p><p>The doses stated in
the BNF are intended for general guidance and represent, unless otherwise
stated, the usual range of doses that are generally regarded as being
suitable for adults.</p><div class="cN"><h3 class="cBP">Prescribing unlicensed medicines</h3><p>Prescribing medicines outside the recommendations of their marketing
authorisation alters (and probably increases) the prescriber’s professional
responsibility and potential liability. The prescriber should be able
to justify and feel competent in using such medicines.</p></div></div></div><div id="_120029"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Oral syringes</h2> <p class="cAX">An <b>oral
syringe</b> is supplied when oral liquid medicines are prescribed
in doses other than multiples of 5 mL. The oral syringe is marked
in 0.5-mL divisions from 1 to 5 mL to measure doses of less than 5 mL
(other sizes of oral syringe may also be available). It is provided
with an adaptor and an instruction leaflet. The <i>5-mL spoon</i> is used for doses of 5 mL (or multiples thereof).</p><div class="cN"><h3 class="cBP">Important</h3><p>To avoid inadvertent intravenous administration of oral liquid
medicines, only an appropriate <b>oral</b> or <b>enteral
syringe</b> should be used to measure an oral liquid medicine
(if a medicine spoon or graduated measure cannot be used); these syringes
should <b>not</b> be compatible with intravenous or other
parenteral devices. Oral or enteral syringes should be clearly labelled
‘Oral’ or ‘Enteral’ in a large font size; it is the healthcare practitioner’s
responsibility to label the syringe with this information if the manufacturer
has not done so.</p></div></div></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Strengths and quantities</h2> <p class="cAX">The strength or quantity
to be contained in capsules, lozenges, tablets, etc. should be stated
by the prescriber. In particular, strengths of liquid preparations
should be clearly stated (e.g. 125 mg/5 mL).</p><p>If a pharmacist receives an incomplete prescription for a systemically
administered preparation and considers it would not be appropriate
for the patient to return to the doctor, the following procedures
will apply<sup class="footnote"><a title="Go to footnote" href="29404.htm#footnote112900">(1)</a></sup>:</p><ol class="cBH"><li><p class="cQ">an attempt must always be made to contact the prescriber
to ascertain the intention;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">if the attempt is successful the pharmacist must, where
practicable, subsequently arrange for details of quantity, strength
where applicable, and dosage to be inserted by the prescriber on the
incomplete form;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">where, although the prescriber has been contacted, it
has not proved possible to obtain the written intention regarding
an incomplete prescription, the pharmacist may endorse the form ‘p.c.’
(prescriber contacted) and add details of the quantity and strength
where applicable of the preparation supplied, and of the dose indicated.
The endorsement should be initialled and dated by the pharmacist;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">where the prescriber cannot be contacted and the pharmacist
has sufficient information to make a professional judgement the preparation
may be dispensed. If the quantity is missing the pharmacist may supply
sufficient to complete up to 5 days’ treatment; except that where
a combination pack (i.e. a proprietary pack containing more than one
medicinal product) or oral contraceptive is prescribed by name only,
the smallest pack shall be dispensed. In all cases the prescription
must be endorsed ‘p.n.c.’ (prescriber not contacted), the quantity,
the dose, and the strength (where applicable) of the preparation supplied
must be indicated, and the endorsement must be initialled and dated;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">if the pharmacist has any doubt about exercising discretion,
an incomplete prescription must be referred back to the prescriber.</p></li></ol></div><div id="_120000"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Excipients</h2> <p class="cAX">Branded oral liquid preparations
that do not contain <i> fructose</i>, <i><span>glucose</span></i>, or <i>sucrose</i> are described as ‘sugar-free’ in the BNF.
Preparations containing hydrogenated <span>glucose</span> syrup, <span>mannitol</span>, maltitol, sorbitol, or xylitol are also marked ‘sugar-free’
since there is evidence that they do not cause dental caries. Patients
receiving medicines containing cariogenic sugars should be advised
of appropriate dental hygiene measures to prevent caries. Sugar-free
preparations should be used whenever possible.</p><p>Where information on the presence of <i>aspartame</i><i>, gluten</i>, <i>sulphites</i>, <i>tartrazine</i>, <i>arachis (peanut) oil</i> or <i>sesame oil</i> is available, this is indicated in the BNF against the relevant
preparation.</p><p>Information is provided on <i>selected excipients</i> in skin preparations (<a title=" Excipients and sensitisation" href="72482.htm#_72482">section 13.1.3</a>), in vaccines (<a title="section: Active immunity" href="6451.htm#_6451">section 14.1</a>), and on <i>selected preservatives</i> and <i>excipients</i> in eye drops and injections.</p><p>The presence of <i>benzyl <span>alcohol</span></i> and <i>polyoxyl castor oil</i> (polyethoxylated castor oil) in injections is indicated in
the BNF. Benzyl <span>alcohol</span> has been associated with
a fatal toxic syndrome in preterm neonates, and therefore, parenteral
preparations containing the preservative should not be used in neonates.
Polyoxyl castor oils, used as vehicles in intravenous injections,
have been associated with severe anaphylactoid reactions.</p><p>The presence of <i>propylene glycol</i> in oral or parenteral
medicines is indicated in the BNF; it can cause adverse effects if
its elimination is impaired, e.g. in renal failure, in neonates and
young children, and in slow metabolisers of the substance. It may
interact with disulfiram and metronidazole.</p><p>The <i>lactose</i> content in most medicines is too small to cause problems in most
lactose-intolerant patients. However in severe lactose intolerance,
the lactose content should be determined before prescribing. The amount
of lactose varies according to manufacturer, product, formulation,
and strength.</p><div class="cN"><h3 class="cBP">Important</h3><p>In the absence of information on excipients in the BNF and in
the product literature (available at <a href="http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc" title="external link">www.medicines.org.uk/emc</a>), contact the manufacturer (see Index of Manufacturers) if it is
essential to check details.</p></div></div></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Extemporaneous preparation</h2> <p class="cAX">A product should be dispensed
extemporaneously only when no product with a marketing authorisation
is available.</p><p>The BP direction that a preparation must be<i> freshly
prepared</i> indicates that it must be made not more than 24
hours before it is issued for use. The direction that a preparation
should be <i>recently prepared</i> indicates that deterioration
is likely if the preparation is stored for longer than about 4 weeks
at 15–25° C.</p><p>The term <b>water</b> used without qualification means
either potable water freshly drawn direct
from the public supply and suitable for drinking or freshly boiled
and cooled purified water. The latter should be used if the public
supply is from a local storage tank or if the potable water is unsuitable
for a particular preparation (Water for injections, <a title=" Parenteral preparations for fluid and electrolyte imbalance" href="4970.htm#_4970">section 9.2.2</a>).</p></div><div id="_120507"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Drugs and driving</h2> <p class="cAX">Prescribers and other healthcare professionals
should advise patients if treatment is likely to affect their ability
to perform skilled tasks (e.g. driving). This applies especially to
drugs with sedative effects; patients should be warned that these
effects are increased by <span>alcohol</span>. General information
about a patient’s fitness to drive is available from the Driver and
Vehicle Licensing Agency at <a href="http://www.dvla.gov.uk" title="external link">www.dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p></div></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Patents</h2> <p class="cAX">In the BNF, certain drugs have been included
notwithstanding the existence of actual or potential patent rights.
In so far as such substances are protected by Letters Patent, their inclusion in this Formulary
neither conveys, nor implies, licence to manufacture.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Health and safety</h2> <p class="cAX">When handling chemical or biological
materials particular attention should be given to the possibility
of allergy, fire, explosion, radiation, or poisoning. Substances such
as <span>corticosteroids</span>, some antimicrobials, phenothiazines,
and many cytotoxics, are irritant or very potent and should be handled
with caution. Contact with the skin and inhalation of dust should
be avoided.</p></div><div id="_120034"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Safety in the home</h2> <p class="cAX">Patients must be warned to
keep all medicines out of the reach of children. All solid dose and all oral
and external liquid preparations must be dispensed in a reclosable <i>child-resistant container</i> unless:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">the medicine is in an original pack or patient pack such
as to make this inadvisable;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">the patient will have difficulty in opening a child-resistant
container;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">a specific request is made that the product shall not
be dispensed in a child-resistant container;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">no suitable child-resistant container exists for a particular
liquid preparation.</p></li></ul><p>All patients should be advised to dispose of <i>unwanted
medicines</i> by returning them to a supplier for destruction.</p></div></div><div class="cAZ" id="_120031"><h2>Name of medicine</h2> <p class="cAX">The name of the medicine should
appear on the label unless the prescriber indicates otherwise.</p><ol class="cBH"><li><p class="cQ">The strength is also stated on the label in the case of
tablets, capsules, and similar preparations that are available in
different strengths.</p></li><li><p class="cQ">If it is the wish of the prescriber that a description
such as ‘The Sedative Tablets’ should appear on the label, the prescriber
should write the desired description on the prescription form.</p></li><li><p class="cQ">The arrangement will extend to approved names, proprietary
names or titles given in the BP, BPC, BNF, DPF, or NPF.</p></li><li><p class="cQ">The name written on the label is that used by the prescriber
on the prescription.</p></li><li><p class="cQ">When a prescription is written other than on an NHS prescription
form the name of the prescribed preparation will be stated on the
label of the dispensed medicine unless the prescriber indicates otherwise.</p></li><li><p class="cQ">The Council of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society advises
that the labels of dispensed medicines should indicate the total quantity
of the product dispensed in the container to which the label refers.
This requirement applies equally to solid, liquid, internal, and external
preparations. If a product is dispensed in more than one container,
the reference should be to the amount in each container.</p></li></ol><div id="_120030"><div class="cN"><h3 class="cBP">Non-proprietary names of compound preparations</h3><p>Non-proprietary names of <b>compound preparations</b> which appear in the BNF are those that have been compiled by the
British Pharmacopoeia Commission or another recognised body; whenever
possible they reflect the names of the active ingredients.</p><p>Prescribers should avoid creating their own compound names for
the purposes of generic prescribing; such names do not have an approved
definition and can be misinterpreted.</p><p>Special care should be taken to avoid errors when prescribing
compound preparations; in particular the hyphen in the prefix ‘co-’
should be retained.</p><p>Special care should also be taken to avoid creating generic
names for <b>modified-release</b> preparations where the
use of these names could lead to confusion between formulations with
different lengths of action.</p></div></div></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>EEA and Swiss prescriptions</h2> <p class="cAX">Pharmacists can dispense prescriptions
issued by doctors and dentists from the European Economic Area (EEA)
or Switzerland (except prescriptions for controlled drugs in Schedules
1, 2, or 3, or for drugs without a UK marketing authorisation). Prescriptions
should be written in ink or otherwise so as to be indelible, should
be dated, should state the name of the patient, should state the address
of the prescriber, should contain particulars indicating whether the
prescriber is a doctor or dentist, and should be signed by the prescriber.</p></div><div class="cAZ"><h2>Security and validity of prescriptions</h2> <p class="cAX">The Councils
of the British Medical Association and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society
have issued a joint statement on the security and validity of prescriptions.</p><p>In particular, prescription forms should:</p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">not be left unattended at reception desks;</p></li><li><p class="cQ">not be left in a car where they may be visible; and</p></li><li><p class="cQ">when not in use, be kept in a locked drawer within the
surgery and at home.</p></li></ul><p>Where there is any doubt about the authenticity of a prescription,
the pharmacist should contact the prescriber. If this is done by telephone,
the number should be obtained from the directory rather than relying
on the information on the prescription form, which may be false.</p></div><div id="_202441"><div class="cAZ"><h2>Patient group direction (PGD)</h2> <p class="cAX">In most cases, the
most appropriate clinical care will be provided on an individual basis
by a prescriber to a specific individual patient. However, a Patient
Group Direction for supply and administration of medicines by other
healthcare professionals can be used where it would benefit patient
care without compromising safety.</p><p>A Patient Group Direction is a written direction relating to
the supply and administration (or administration only) of a licensed
prescription-only medicine by certain classes of healthcare professionals;
the Direction is signed by a doctor (or dentist) and by a pharmacist.
Further information on Patient Group Directions is available in Health
Service Circular HSC 2000/026 (England), HDL (2001) 7 (Scotland),
and WHC (2000) 116 (Wales) and at <a href="http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/Communities/NELM/PGDs" title="external link">www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/Communities/NeLM/PGDs</a>.</p></div></div><div id="_200790"><div class="cAZ"><h2>NICE and Scottish Medicines Consortium</h2> <p class="cAX">Advice issued by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
