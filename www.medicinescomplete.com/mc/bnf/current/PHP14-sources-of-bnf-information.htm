The SPCs are the principal source of product information and are carefully processed, despite the ever-increasing volume of information being issued by the pharmaceutical industry. Such processing involves:</p><ul><li><p>verifying the approved names of all relevant ingredients including ‘non-active’ ingredients (the BNF is committed to using approved names and descriptions as laid down by the Medicines Act);</p> </li><li><p>comparing the indications, cautions, contra-indications, and side-effects with similar existing drugs. Where these are different from the expected pattern, justification is sought for their inclusion or exclusion;</p> </li><li><p>seeking independent data on the use of drugs in pregnancy and breast-feeding;</p> </li><li><p>incorporating the information into the BNF using established criteria for the presentation and inclusion of the data;</p> </li><li><p>checking interpretation of the information by one clinical writer before submitting to a lead editor; changes relating to doses receive an extra check;</p> </li><li><p>identifying potential clinical problems or omissions and seeking further information from manufacturers or from expert advisers;</p> </li><li><p>careful validation of any areas of divergence of the BNF from the SPC before discussion by the Committee (in the light of supporting evidence);</p> </li><li><p>constructing, with the help of expert advisers, a comment on the role of the drug in the context of similar drugs.</p> </li></ul><p>Much of this processing is applicable to the following sources as well.</p></div><div><h2>Expert advisers</h2><p>The role of expert clinical advisers in providing the appropriate clinical context for all BNF information is discussed above.</p></div><div><h2>Literature</h2><p>Clinical writers monitor core medical and pharmaceutical journals. Research papers and reviews relating to drug therapy are carefully processed. When a difference between the advice in the BNF and the paper is noted, the new information is assessed for reliability and relevance to UK clinical practice. If necessary, new text is drafted and discussed with expert advisers and the Joint Formulary Committee. The BNF enjoys a close working relationship with a number of national information providers.</p></div><div><h2>Systematic reviews</h2><p>The BNF has access to various databases of systematic reviews (including the Cochrane Library and various web-based resources). These are used for answering specific queries, for reviewing existing text and for constructing new text. Clinical writers receive training in critical appraisal, literature evaluation, and search strategies. Reviews published in Clinical Evidence are used to validate BNF advice.</p></div><div><h2>Consensus guidelines</h2><p>The advice in the BNF is checked against consensus guidelines produced by expert bodies. A number of bodies make drafts or pre-publication copies of the guidelines available to the BNF; it is therefore possible to ensure that a consistent message is disseminated. The BNF routinely processes guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).</p></div><div><h2>Reference sources</h2><p>Textbooks and reference sources are used to provide background information for the review of existing text or for the construction of new text. The BNF team works closely with the editorial team that produces <em>Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference</em>. The BNF has access to <em>Martindale</em> information resources and each team keeps the other informed of significant developments and shifts in the trends of drug usage.</p></div><div><h2>Statutory information</h2><p>The BNF routinely processes relevant information from various Government bodies including Statutory Instruments and regulations affecting the Prescription only Medicines Order. Official compendia such as the British Pharmacopoeia and its addenda are processed routinely to ensure that the BNF complies with the relevant sections of the Medicines Act. The BNF itself is named as an official compendium in the Medicines Act.</p><p>The BNF maintains close links with the Home Office (in relation to controlled drug regulations) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (including the British Pharmacopoeia Commission). Safety warnings issued by the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) and guidelines on drug use issued by the UK health departments are processed as a matter of routine.</p><p>Relevant professional statements issued by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society are included in the BNF as are guidelines from bodies such as the Royal College of General Practitioners.</p><p>The BNF reflects information from the Drug Tariff, the Scottish Drug Tariff, and the Northern Ireland Drug Tariff.</p></div><div><h2>Pricing information</h2><p>NHS Prescription Services (from the NHS Business Services Authority) provides information on prices of medicinal products and appliances in the BNF.</p></div><div><h2>Comments from readers</h2><p>Readers of the BNF are invited to send in comments. Numerous letters and emails are received during the preparation of each edition. Such feedback helps to ensure that the BNF provides practical and clinically relevant information. Many changes in the presentation and scope of the BNF have resulted from comments sent in by users.</p></div><div><h2>Comments from industry</h2><p>Close scrutiny of the BNF by the manufacturers provides an additional check and allows them an opportunity to raise issues about the BNF's presentation of the role of various drugs; this is yet another check on the balance of the BNF's advice. All comments are looked at with care and, where necessary, additional information and expert advice are sought.</p></div><div><h2>Virtual user groups </h2><p>The BNF has set up virtual user groups across various healthcare professions (e.g. doctors, pharmacists, nurses, dentists). The aim of these groups will be to provide feedback to the editors and publishers to ensure that BNF publications continue to serve the needs of its users.</p></div><div><h2>Market research </h2><p>Market research is conducted at regular intervals to gather feedback on specific areas of development, such as drug interactions or changes to the way information is presented in digital formats.</p></div><div class="cI"><p>The BNF is an independent professional publication that is kept up-to-date and addresses the day-to-day prescribing information needs of healthcare professionals. Use of this resource throughout the health service helps to ensure that medicines are used safely, effectively, and appropriately.</p></div></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="PHP13-expert-advisers.htm">Previous: Expert advisers</a> | <a class="top" href="PHP14-sources-of-bnf-information.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="PHP15-how-to-use-the-bnf.htm">Next: How to use the BNF</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Cookie and Privacy Policy">Cookie and Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="PHP0-publication-information.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and Pharmaceutical Press 2012.
