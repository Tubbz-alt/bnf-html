Ideally, patients with moderate to severe depression should be treated with psychological therapy in addition to drug therapy. Antidepressant drugs are also effective for dysthymia (lower grade chronic depression (typically of at least 2 years duration)).</p><p>Antidepressant drugs should not be used routinely in mild depression, and psychological therapy should be considered initially; however, a trial of antidepressant therapy may be considered in cases refractory to psychological treatments or in those associated with psychosocial or medical problems. Drug treatment of mild depression may also be considered in patients with a history of moderate or severe depression.</p><div><h2>Choice</h2><p>The major classes of antidepressant drugs include the tricyclic and related antidepressants (<a title="BNF:sub-section: Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs" href="PHP2352-tricyclic-and-related-antidepressant-drugs.htm">section 4.3.1</a>), the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (<a title="BNF:sub-section: Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors" href="PHP2413-selective-serotonin-re-uptake-inhibitors.htm">section 4.3.3</a>), and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (<a title="BNF:sub-section: Monoamine-oxidase inhibitors" href="PHP2395-monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors.htm">section 4.3.2</a>). A number of antidepressant drugs cannot be accommodated easily into this classification; these are included in <a title=" Other antidepressant drugs" href="PHP2438-other-antidepressant-drugs.htm">section 4.3.4</a>.</p><p>There is little to choose between the different classes of antidepressant drugs in terms of efficacy, so choice should be based on the individual patient's requirements, including the presence of concomitant disease, existing therapy, suicide risk, and previous response to antidepressant therapy. Since there may be an interval of 2 weeks before the antidepressant action takes place, electroconvulsive treatment may be required in severe depression when delay is hazardous or intolerable. During the first few weeks of treatment, there is an increased potential for agitation, anxiety, and <a title="BNF:target-block: antidepressants and suicide" href="PHP2347-antidepressant-drugs.htm#PHP2349">suicidal ideation</a>.</p><p>SSRIs are better tolerated and are safer in overdose than other classes of antidepressants and should be considered first-line for treating depression. In patients with unstable angina or who have had a recent myocardial infarction, sertraline has been shown to be safe.</p><p>Tricyclic antidepressants have similar efficacy to SSRIs but are more likely to be discontinued because of side-effects; toxicity in overdosage is also a problem. See <a title="sub-section: Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs" href="PHP2352-tricyclic-and-related-antidepressant-drugs.htm">section 4.3.1</a> for more details.</p><p>MAOIs have dangerous interactions with some foods and drugs, and should be reserved for use by specialists.</p><p>Although anxiety is often present in depressive illness (and may be the presenting symptom), the use of an antipsychotic or an anxiolytic may mask the true diagnosis. Anxiolytics (<a title=" Anxiolytics" href="PHP2151-anxiolytics.htm">section 4.1.2</a>) or antipsychotic drugs (<a title=" Antipsychotic drugs" href="PHP2194-antipsychotic-drugs.htm">section 4.2.1</a>) should therefore be used with caution in depression but they are useful adjuncts in agitated patients. Augmenting antidepressants with antipsychotics under specialist supervision may also be necessary in patients who have depression with psychotic symptoms.</p><p>See <a title=" Antimanic drugs" href="PHP2324-antimanic-drugs.htm">section 4.2.3</a> for notes on the management of bipolar disorder.</p><p><strong>St John's wort</strong> (<em>Hypericum perforatum</em>) is a popular herbal remedy on sale to the public for treating mild depression. It should not be prescribed or recommended for depression because St John's wort can induce drug metabolising enzymes and a number of important interactions with conventional drugs, including conventional antidepressants, have been identified (see Appendix 1, St John's wort). Furthermore, the amount of active ingredient varies between different preparations of St John's wort and switching from one to another can change the degree of enzyme induction. If a patient stops taking St John's wort, the concentration of interacting drugs may increase, leading to toxicity.</p> <div class="cI" id="PHP2348"><h3 class="cT">Hyponatraemia and antidepressant therapy</h3><p>Hyponatraemia (usually in the elderly and possibly due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone) has been associated with all types of antidepressants; however, it has been reported more frequently with SSRIs than with other antidepressants. Hyponatraemia should be considered in all patients who develop drowsiness, confusion, or convulsions while taking an antidepressant.</p></div> <div class="cI" id="PHP2349"><h3 class="cT">Suicidal behaviour and antidepressant therapy</h3><p>The use of antidepressants has been linked with suicidal thoughts and behaviour; children, young adults, and patients with a history of suicidal behaviour are particularly at risk. Where necessary patients should be monitored for suicidal behaviour, self-harm, or hostility, particularly at the beginning of treatment or if the dose is changed.</p></div> </div><div><h2>Management</h2><p>Patients should be reviewed every 1–2 weeks at the start of antidepressant treatment. Treatment should be continued for at least 4 weeks (6 weeks in the elderly) before considering whether to switch antidepressant due to lack of efficacy. In cases of partial response, continue for a further 2–4 weeks (elderly patients may take longer to respond). </p><p>Following remission, antidepressant treatment should be continued at the same dose for at least 6 months (about 12 months in the elderly), or for at least 12 months in patients receiving treatment for generalised anxiety disorder (as the likelihood of relapse is high). Patients with a history of recurrent depression should receive maintenance treatment for at least 2 years.</p></div><div><h2>Failure to respond</h2><p>Failure to respond to initial treatment with an SSRI may require an increase in the dose, or switching to a different SSRI or mirtazapine. Other second-line choices include lofepramine, moclobemide, and reboxetine. Other tricyclic antidepressants and venlafaxine should be considered for more severe forms of depression; irreversible MAOIs should only be prescribed by specialists. Failure to respond to a second antidepressant may require the addition of another antidepressant of a different class, or use of an augmenting agent (such as lithium (<a title="BNF:monograph-family: Lithium" href="PHP2334-lithium.htm">section 4.2.3</a>), aripiprazole [unlicensed], olanzapine [unlicensed], quetiapine, or risperidone [unlicensed] (<a title="BNF:monograph-family: Second-generation antipsychotic drugs" href="PHP2267-second-generation-antipsychotic-drugs.htm">section 4.2.1</a>)), but such adjunctive treatment should be initiated only by doctors with special experience of these combinations. Electroconvulsive therapy may be initiated in severe refractory depression.</p></div><div id="PHP2350"><h2>Withdrawal</h2><p>Withdrawal effects may occur within 5 days of stopping treatment with antidepressant drugs; they are usually mild and self-limiting, but in some cases may be severe. Drugs with a shorter half-life, such as <a title="BNF:monograph: PAROXETINE" href="PHP2432-paroxetine.htm">paroxetine</a> and <a title="BNF:monograph: VENLAFAXINE" href="PHP2459-venlafaxine.htm">venlafaxine</a>, are associated with a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms. The risk of withdrawal symptoms is also increased if the antidepressant is stopped suddenly after regular administration for 8 weeks or more. The dose should preferably be reduced gradually over about 4 weeks, or longer if withdrawal symptoms emerge (6 months in patients who have been on long-term maintenance treatment). See also <a title="BNF:target-block: Tricyclic and related antidepressants and withdrawal" href="PHP2352-tricyclic-and-related-antidepressant-drugs.htm#PHP2355">section 4.3.1</a>, <a title="BNF:sub-section: Monoamine-oxidase inhibitors" href="PHP2395-monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors.htm">section 4.3.2</a>, and <a title="BNF:target-text: SSRI withdrawal" href="PHP2413-selective-serotonin-re-uptake-inhibitors.htm#PHP2416">section 4.3.3</a>.</p></div><div id="PHP2351"><h2>Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder</h2><p>Management of acute anxiety generally involves the use of a benzodiazepine or buspirone (<a title="monograph-family: Buspirone" href="PHP2175-buspirone.htm">section 4.1.2</a>). For chronic anxiety (of longer than 4 weeks' duration) it may be appropriate to use an antidepressant. Combined therapy with a benzodiazepine may be required until the antidepressant takes effect. Patients with <em>generalised anxiety disorder</em>, a form of chronic anxiety, should be offered psychological treatment before initiating an antidepressant. If drug treatment is needed, an SSRI such as escitalopram, paroxetine, or sertraline [unlicensed], can be used. Duloxetine and venlafaxine (serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) are also recommended for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder; if the patient cannot tolerate SSRIs or serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (or if treatment has failed to control symptoms), pregabalin can be considered.</p><p><em>Panic disorder</em>, <em>obsessive-compulsive disorder</em>, <em>post-traumatic stress disorder</em>, and phobic states such as <em>social anxiety disorder</em> are treated with SSRIs. Clomipramine or imipramine can be used second-line in panic disorder [unlicensed]; clomipramine can also be used second-line for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Moclobemide is licensed for the treatment of social anxiety disorder.</p></div></div><div id="pS"><p>Sub-sections</p><ul class="jT"><li id="_PHP2352-tricyclic-and-related-antidepressant-drugs"><a href="PHP2352-tricyclic-and-related-antidepressant-drugs.htm" title="4.3.1 Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs">4.3.1 Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs</a></li><li id="_PHP2395-monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors"><a href="PHP2395-monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors.htm" title="4.3.2 Monoamine-oxidase inhibitors">4.3.2 Monoamine-oxidase inhibitors</a></li><li id="_PHP2413-selective-serotonin-re-uptake-inhibitors"><a href="PHP2413-selective-serotonin-re-uptake-inhibitors.htm" title="4.3.3 Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors">4.3.3 Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors</a></li><li id="_PHP2438-other-antidepressant-drugs"><a href="PHP2438-other-antidepressant-drugs.htm" title="4.3.4 Other antidepressant drugs">4.3.4 Other antidepressant drugs</a></li></ul></div><?highlighter off?><div id="pE">◄ <a accesskey="[" href="PHP2344-lithium-citrate.htm">Previous: LITHIUM CITRATE</a> | <a class="top" href="PHP2347-antidepressant-drugs.htm#">Top</a> | <a accesskey="]" href="PHP2352-tricyclic-and-related-antidepressant-drugs.htm">Next: 4.3.1 Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs</a> ►</div></div></div><div id="pF"><div id="pL"><div id="footer"><div id="footerinner"><ul><li><a accesskey="0" href="accessibility.htm" title="Accessibility information: access key 0">Accessibility</a> | </li><li><a href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/marketing/current/contact.htm">Contact Us</a> | </li><li><a href="privacy.htm" title="Cookie and Privacy Policy">Cookie and Privacy Policy</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="3" href="http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/sitemap.htm" title="Site Map: access key 3">Site Map</a> | </li><li><a accesskey="8" href="terms.htm" title="Terms and Conditions: access key 8">Terms and Conditions</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="pX"><p><a href="PHP0-publication-information.htm" rel="copyright">Copyright © BMJ Group and Pharmaceutical Press 2012.
