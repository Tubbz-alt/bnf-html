alpha glucosidases, delays the digestion and absorption of starch
and sucrose; it has a small but significant effect in lowering blood
glucose. Use of acarbose is usually reserved for when other oral hypoglycaemics
are not tolerated or are contra-indicated. Postprandial hyperglycaemia
in type 1 diabetes can be reduced by <span>acarbose</span>,
but it has been little used for this purpose. Flatulence deters some
from using <span>acarbose</span> although this side-effect tends
to decrease with time.</p><p><b><span>Nateglinide</span></b> and <b><span>repaglinide</span></b> stimulate
insulin release. Both drugs have a rapid onset of action and short
duration of activity, and should be administered shortly before each
main meal. <span>Repaglinide</span> may be given as monotherapy
for patients who are not overweight or for those in whom metformin
is contra-indicated or not tolerated, or it may be given in combination
with metformin. <span>Nateglinide</span> is licensed only for
use with metformin.</p><p>The thiazolidinedione, <b><span>pioglitazone</span></b>, reduces peripheral insulin
resistance, leading to a reduction of blood-glucose concentration.
Pioglitazone can be used alone or in combination with metformin or
with a sulfonylurea (if metformin inappropriate), or with both; the
combination of pioglitazone plus metformin is preferred to pioglitazone
plus sulfonylurea, particularly for obese patients. Inadequate response
to a combination of metformin and sulfonylurea may indicate failing
insulin release; the introduction of <span>pioglitazone</span> has a limited role in these circumstances and the initiation of
insulin is often more appropriate. Pioglitazone is also licensed in
combination with insulin, in patients who have not achieved adequate
glycaemic control with insulin alone, when metformin is inappropriate. Blood-glucose control may deteriorate temporarily when pioglitazone
is substituted for an oral antidiabetic drug that is being used in
combination with another. Long-term benefits of pioglitazone
have not yet been demonstrated. NICE (May 2009) has recommended that,
when glycaemic control is inadequate with existing treatment, pioglitazone
can be added to: </p><ul class="cBF"><li><p class="cQ">a sulfonylurea, if metformin is contra-indicated or not

is unacceptable because of lifestyle or other personal issues, or
because the patient is obese.</p></li></ul><p>NICE has recommended that treatment with pioglitazone is continued

within 6 months of starting treatment.</p><p>The <a title="BNF:target-block: NICE and Scottish Medicines Consortium" href="29404.htm#_200790"><i>Scottish Medicines

of pioglitazone continue to outweigh the risks.</p><p>Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with active bladder
cancer or a past history of bladder cancer, or in those who have uninvestigated
macroscopic haematuria. Pioglitazone should be used with caution in
elderly patients as the risk of bladder cancer increases with age.</p><p>Before initiating treatment with pioglitazone,
patients should be assessed for risk factors of bladder cancer (including age, smoking status, exposure to certain occupational
or chemotherapy agents, or previous radiation therapy to the pelvic
region) and any macroscopic haematuria should be investigated. The
safety and efficacy of pioglitazone should be reviewed after 3–6 months
and pioglitazone should be stopped in patients who do not respond
adequately to treatment.</p><p>Patients already receiving treatment with pioglitazone should
be assessed for risk factors of bladder cancer and treatment should
